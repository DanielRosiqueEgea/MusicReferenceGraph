"London Borough of Enfield, Edmonton, N9Edmonton, within the N9 postcode, has been the location of several generational street gangs since the 1990s.The first gang to have influence over Edmonton in the late 1990s and the early 2000s were known as the \u2018Edmonton Firm\u2019 or more commonly the \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 / EMD.The gangs main territory was within the N9 postcode which covers the lower Edmonton area although they would draw their membership from across the borough, especially Edmonton Green, upper Edmonton, Jubilee Park, Bush Hill Park and the Ponders End area.This generation had grown in schools across Haringey and Edmonton would arise as the \u2018Firm\u2019 throughout 1994/95 following on from the Tottenham gangs like the \u2018Broadwater Farm Posse\u2019, and the \u2018Tottenham Mandem / TMD.When the other areas within the \u2018Firm\u2019 began to associate more locally areas outside of Tottenham became known as \u2018Wood Green Firm\u2019, which later became known as Wood Green MOB and \u2018Edmonton Firm\u2019/ \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 / EMD from 1996/97.In the mid to late 1990s much of North London, Tottenham, Edmonton, Hornsey and Wood Green were aligned with one another and the \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 were equally as known as their allies in the \u2018Tottenham Mandem\u2019.Much of the gang activity in North London from the 1980s and the early 1990s was heavily influenced by Tottenham street gangs and older criminals emanating from the Broadwater Farm estate.The younger generation of \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 / EMD who formed in 2002/03 became known as the \u2018Shankstarz\u2019.The \u2018Shankstarz\u2019 developed as the younger generation to the old \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 / EMD, and earned the Edmonton area the nickname Shanktown for their numerous stabbings and knife-point robberies.\u2018Shankstarz\u2019 were most active around Lower Edmonton with Bounces Road estate being the main base for \u2018Shankstarz\u2019 and \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 / EMD.They were also active in other areas of the borough including the New Southgate area and Alma Road estate, in Ponders End.The \u2018Shankstarz\u2019 were known for their rivalry with NPK from Tottenham.The beef started around 2003 and was the start of the Edmonton-Tottenham rivalry which has been ongoing to this day.Before this \u2018Edmonton Mandem\u2019 and \u2018Tottenham Mandem\u2019 had been closely allied for many years.Their beef with NPK brought them into conflicts with other Tottenham sets including \u2018Tiverton\u2019, \u2018Ida\u2019 and \u2018EvaStrap\u2019.The main allies of \u2018Shankstarz\u2019 were the \u2018Wood Green MOB\u2019.Edmonton and Wood Green had a shared hatred of Tottenham and formed an alliance.With gang definers playing a larger part in gang activity at the time, symbolism and gang colours started to be used more frequently by younger members of the gangs.The \u2018Shankstarz\u2019 and \u2018Wood Green MOB\u2019 both identified with the colour green and had began sporting green clothing and bandanas.\u2018Wood Green to Edmonton Green\u2019 became known as the \u2018Green City\u2019 alliance, and \u2018Shanktown to Mobtown\u2019, as Wood Green was known.They were also allied with P-Town / Palmers Green.By the late 2000s some younger members began to refer to themselves as \u2018Camp\u2019 or \u2018North Camp\u2019.By 2007 another Edmonton gang began to make a name for themselves.They are known as the \u2018Dem Africans\u2019 / DA and are particularly active on the Barbot estate / 41st Side, Edmonton Green estate, Osward Place and nearby Croyland Road.The \u2018Dem Africans\u2019 / DA olders were primarily African youths who started to make a name for themselves in 2007 and were one of a handful of new younger gangs emerging in Edmonton at that time.The others were \u2018Red Brick Thugs\u2019 and \u2018Edmonton Grey Gang\u2019.Some \u2018Dem Africans\u2019 olders had a few years earlier been part of an old street gang known as \u2018Tottenham Foosie Thugs\u2019 \u2018Foosie Thugs\u2019 moved away from Tottenham and began to occupy new areas such as the new Barbot estate redevelopment in the mid 2000s.The original members used the acronym BMW, which is said to stand for \u2018Boydems Most Wanted\u2019 before they became

Williams, Big Bob the Hawk, Melvin Farmer, Judson Bacot, Angelo \u201cBarefoot Pookie\u201d White and Mad Dog.Kody \u201cMonster\u201d Scott / Sanyika Shakur, a member of this gang wrote a popular autobiography entitled An Autobiography of an L.A. Gangs Member while he was in prison during the late 1980s and early 1990s and in 2006 the rights to his book were sold and adopted into a screen play.According to Shakur\u2019s book,  Rayford \u201cBig Sidewinder\u201d Miles was the founder who created this neighborhood which was a split off from the West Side Crips.According to Judson Bacot, Sidewinder, cofounded the set with Jeffrey \u201cBig Bay\u201d Bacot, Cornell \u201cHunchy\u201d  McKinney, Melvin \u201cSkull\u201d Farmer and Jesse \u201cHillbilly\u201d Ford\u201d were also cofounders.The original name, Original Gangster Crips, was created by Skull, but after he was arrested, Sidewinder changed the named slightly to Eight Tray Gangster Crips, because he actually lived on 83rd Street.Even though the set started on 83rd Street, it spanned north and south stretching from roughly Gage to Century, covering over 40 city blocks similar to the old boundaries of the West Side Crips.Over the years, they formed several sub-clicks and including theOriginal South SideDeep South SideBacc West SideFar West SideNutty North SideA section of their turf extends west past Western Avenue where St Andrews Park is located.Scott has appeared on BET, 20th Century, and 60 minutes, and several other programs and magazines discussing his experiences in the Eight Tray Crips addressing the gang situation in Los Angeles.His younger brother, Kershaun \u201cLil Monster\u201d Scott has been a part of the the peace movement and was involved in the gang truce of 1992.Monster was named to the top 10 most wanted gang members February 7, 2007 and was arrested on March 7, 2007 for assault and car-jacking.Because of his popularity the City of LA made a political decision to place Scott on the list above other gang members wanted for murder. According to the LAPD press release, Scott was identified on the 7600 block of Brighton Street by a tipster and was later apprehended.The LAPD also stated that Scott had been in and out of prison for 26 years of his life and that he was the \u201cself proclaimed founder\u201d of the Eight Tray Gangster Crips.Lil Monster appeared in the HBO documentary, Bastards of the Party.Because of the media popularity of this gang, it is one of the most reported Los Angeles based Crip gangs in the United States having been identified inDenver, COAurora, COHennepin, MinnesotaHarris County, TX; Wichita, KSSt. Louis, MOAlbuquerque, NMPortland, ORThese other gangs are not connected to Los Angeles and are not part of a national network.Youth from these cities have adapted this identity because of its popularity.The Rollin 60s Crips are their main rivals and this conflict goes back to 1979.It is one of the biggest and most fierce rivalries between any two gangs in the County.Although there have been some new conflict during the 21st Century that has been extremely violent, such as the Blood Stone Villain vs. Pueblos Bloods and the East Coast Crips vs. Florence, the conflict between the 60s and 83s are among two of the largest gangs in Los Angeles and has existed for over 30 years.The rivalry between the Rollin 60s and Eight Trays has become a rivalry between N-Hood Crips and Gangster Crips, which extends the conflict from the two gangs into a regional one.This rivalry is discussed in Scott\u2019s book Autobiography of an LA Gang Member and Donald Bakeer\u2019s book, Crips.So far, a truce or a cease fire between these 2 sets has not been implemented, but if possible a truce between all \u201cGangster Crip\u201d sets that fall under the Eight Trays, and the N-Hood sets which fall under the Rollin Sixties would be revolutionary.The ETG are also rivals to all \u201cRollin 0s\u201d gangs which would include the Rollin 40s, Rollin 30s and the Rollin 90s.Their rivalry \u201cNeighborHood\u201d or \u201cNH\u201d gangs included the 67 NeighborHood Crips (67 NHC), located on the north side of their territory.They are rivals to all Blood gangs but their main Blood rivalry is with the Inglewood Family Gang (IFG) located to the west of their territory but it must be noted that their rivalry with the Rollin\u2019 60s Crips is stronger than with any blood gang.The IFGs are attributed for the first ETG casualty which predates their rivalry with the Sixties (1979).Their Crip rivalries include:Rollin 30\u2019s40NH55NH57NH58NH60NH67NH90NH100\u2019S NHNH103HTHC111NH112NH115NHUnderGround CripsBCGMenlo CripsBudLong CripsGeer Gang99 Mafia Crips87 Gangsta Crips.Members:8-Ball (R.I.P)Alphonso \u201cAl Capone\u201d Blackwell (R.I.P)Be Kay (R.I.P)Jeffrey \u201cBig Bay\u201d Bacot (R.I.P)Lady Capp (R.I.P)Caveman (R.I.P)Baby China (R.I.P)Cheeseburger (R.I.P)Big Criz (R.I.P)Baby Criz (R.I.P)Cocaine (R.I.P)D.B.

Los Angeles.It is considered one of the oldest and most respected neighborhoods in all of Los Angeles.It dates back to the late 1920s and they have been active in the same community for nearly 100 years.Their rivalry with El Hoyo Maravilla is the oldest gang rivalry in all of Southern California, and possibly the entire United States.Their conflict pre-dates World War II and is still active today.The gang was originally formed by young teens associated with the Catholic Church in the neighborhood.The gang was probably formed in 1925 when there was an influx of Mexican immigrants into Boyle Heights fleeing religious persecution in Mexico.Between 1926 and 1928, persecution in Mexico closed the churches and drove the priests into exile causing hundreds of families to settle in Boyle Heights, a predominately Jewish neighborhood at the time.The Mexican immigrants preserved their Catholic traditions and Father Cordero, one of the exiled Mexican priests, was named administrator of the Mission of Our Lady of Talpa.The first mass was celebrated on Ash Wednesday, 1927 and the first Baptism was recorded on October 27, 1928.It was the young boys of the families that attended this Catholic Church that formed the gang that would eventually become White Fence.The gang came into prominence during the Pachuca era of the 1940s and were one of the first gangs to develop rivalries

They\u2019re a pretty large label, and have put their name on a few notable artists' work, such as Madlib and MF DOOM (Madvillainy), Aesop Rock, Murs, Freeway, and Brother Ali, to name a few.Slug, the lyricist behind Atmosphere, and Ant, the beatmaster, formed Rhymesayers with their crew, Headshots, when Siddiq, fed up with their treatment at a number of local studios, decided to buy his own.Enter Atmosphere, armed with basically its own label, into the\u2026 Underground. A legend of the underground, really. You see, Slug\u2019s deep and complex lyrics were a little much for the limelight of Myspace (I think that was the major social network around 2002.. Or was that Friendster?), and his earlier works stayed relatively quiet.However, compiling work since the Early/Mid 90s, Atmosphere\u2019s discography has amassed into a formidable list, each offering a new sound and sonic exploration, yet all carrying the unreserved reality of Slug\u2019s lyrics and slightly offbeat tone of Ant\u2019s drums.Through his works, Slug tries to find a balance in life, displaying his roots to Minneapolis, affinity to alcohol, and weakness to women, all very proudly and colorfully, bleeding his heart onto the page.His debut album came in God Loves UglyThis album is defined by it\u2019s humorous self-deprication, mixed in with subtle boasts and intricate lyrics, the most \u201cSluggish\u201d songs from this album are, to name a few:The Bass and the MovementModern Man\u2019s HustleFuck You Lucyand Saves The DayAll of which are beautiful displays of poetic art, and have since become classics.Fast forward one year (2003 now) and Atmosphere drops another overfull-length album (23 songs including the bonus tracks), Seven\u2019s TravelsSome good songs to check out from this record are:Trying to Find a BalanceBird Sings Why the Caged I KnowReflectionsAtmosphere\u2019s next album came in 2005 with You Can\u2019t Imagine How Much Fun We\u2019re Having, with notable songs such asSmart Went CrazyandThe ArrivalHe then followed that up with a year-long series of EPs, with one for each season titled \u201cSad Clown Bad Season\u201d the most popular of which being Sad Clown Bad Summer withSunshine, which is Atmosphere\u2019s single most popular songand Don\u2019t Forget, which is one of my personal favorites.In 2009 came When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold, a remarkable feat of production with the ability to hide the real subject of its lines in carefully crafted verses, telling the story of unsung heroes, fallen stars, and the unseen struggles, in songs likeYesterdayPuppetsThe Waitressand, one of the most powerful and empathetic songs, Guarantees (really, take some time to feel and lose yourself in this song)Now, as of recent, Atmosphere has taken a turn in their production, casting a full band ensemble for their most recent EP, To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy and studio album, The Family Sign.In these, Slug dives into emotionally charged topics such as domestic violence in The Last To Say and creates a hauntingly touching and personal sound in songs like Who I\u2019ll Never Be, Something So, Freefallin', and To All My Friends.In all, Atmosphere is a brave and powerful duo. Some of these songs will leave a mark. Some will touch on a mark already left by someone else. They may incite you to anger, they may bring you to tears.

Wiz Khalifa)\u201d: The psychedelic, spacey, downtempo production from Kid Cudi, Earl On The Beat, BNYX\u00ae, and Jean Baptiste was great, as the spaced-out, laid-back melody set the tone brilliantly for the song, and the downtempo, low-key drum pattern gave both Kid Cudi & Wiz Khalifa a lot of room to work and experiment with different flows on this song. The first verse from Kid Cudi was bad \u2013 there\u2019s nothing I can say to sugarcoat it \u2013 Kid Cudi had bad lyrics, a bad flow, and trash vocal delivery that was somewhat muddied by vocal effects. However, much like on the intro track \u201cHUMAN MADE,\u201d Kid Cudi\u2019s best contribution to the song was the chorus. Wiz Khalifa\u2019s verse started out a bit rocky, as his flow was offbeat for the first two lines of his verse, but he eventually found his footing and contributed a great verse to this song. Kid Cudi\u2019s chorus was good, but Wiz Khalifa\u2019s verse was great despite a rocky start, as his triumphant ending line \u201cWe the ones on the corner no one had swagger like\u201d (which references T.I. & JAY-Z\u2019s hit song \u201cSwagga Like Us (feat. Kanye West, Lil Wayne & M.I.A.)\u201d) is a great statement to wrap up a fire verse and a great statement to give strength to Kid Cudi\u2019s swan song final album, as this deluxe edition for INSANO may or may not be Kid Cudi\u2019s last album of his career. Kid Cudi needs to pick it up, but this song was good.\u201cWIN OR LOSE (feat. King Chip)\u201d: Great sample of \u201cEnjoy The Silence\u201d by Depeche Mode; no-namer producer Ramii really cooked by using the melody for Depeche Mode\u2019s classic song on the verses for this track. This song had the first good verse from Kid Cudi, as Kid Cudi\u2019s first verse was very good. Cudder continues to hit on the choruses on this album, as his chorus on this track might\u2019ve been his best one yet \u2013 it was absolutely great. The second verse from King Chip was good, but unfortunately, it didn\u2019t fit the song well at all. King Chip\u2019s flow, lyrics, and vocal delivery were all strong, but while Kid Cudi was rapping and singing about being okay with whatever happens in his life (a great sentiment which is awesome to hear from him), King Chip is rapping about being in the strip club and throwing ones. It doesn\u2019t make any sense given the subject matter of this song and the ethereal sample of Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cEnjoy The Silence,\u201d so even though it\u2019s a good verse, it sounds wrong on this song and is relegated to being mid at best. Kid Cudi did a very good job on this track with his great chorus and very good first verse, but King Chip wasn\u2019t the right feature choice for this track.\u201cBABE AND I\u201d: Well, even Kid Cudi is getting in on the trend of Jersey Club \u2013 it seems that the electrifying, extremely danceable, energetic new club genre will be the genre of 2024, as half of the albums I\u2019ve reviewed so far in 2024 (i.e. 3 out of 6) have had at least one Jersey Club song on them. I really appreciate Kid Cudi for trying out Jersey Club because the genre is fire and I really like it, but this track and Kid Cudi\u2019s music in general is far too chill and psychedelic to be a convincing Jersey Club track. The \u201cboom, boom, boom-boom-boom\u201d signature drum pattern is there, the chopped, fast-paced vocal sample (provided by Denzel Curry on this song) is there as well, but Kid Cudi sings softly and hums for most of this track \u2013 it hardly qualifies or works as a Jersey Club song. This song was good in concept, but had poor execution. Mid overall.\u201cCRASH TEST CUDI (with Crash Test Dummies)\u201d: Another amazing sample use from no-namer producer Ramii (who is quickly making a name for himself with the great sampling and beatmaking he\u2019s doing on this album), as he enlists the help of BNYX\u00ae to sample Canadian alternative rock band Crash Test Dummies\u2019 song \u201cMmm Mmm Mmm Mmm,\u201d hence the credit to Crash Test Dummies and the name of the song, which plays on the band\u2019s name. The production on this song is awesome, as the beat is downtempo, lo-fi, low-key, and laid-back (as well as psychedelic), and already has built-in humming from the sample provided by lead singer Brad Roberts' vocals. However, Kid Cudi gives two mid verses and a mid chorus on this song that show absolutely nothing special. It\u2019s clear Kid Cudi was attempting to rely on the recognizability of this sample to get by on this song, which is not a recipe for success. Mid track.\u201cEVERYBODY LIKE (feat. Pusha T)\u201d: On an obvious Kanye West throwaway beat produced by E.Vax (most likely from the Donda or Donda 2 era, as E.Vax worked extensively with Kanye West on those albums and this beat sounds like something that could\u2019ve been on those albums), Kid Cudi gives a horrendously awful performance with a horrifically awful first verse and a garbage chorus. This track sounds like Kid Cudi is trying to make a bad parody of a hip-hop song, and in the process, he\u2019s making a fool of himself. Kid Cudi\u2019s lyrics, flows, and vocals are all absolutely awful on this song. The second verse from Pusha T isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not great either. There are a few good lines, but ultimately, this verse is mid and a disappointment, especially by Pusha T\u2019s standards. Pusha T is a cheat-code feature, so the fact that he gave a mid verse on this song and a terrible outro to follow it when he was desperately needed to make the song sound at least mid is a massive letdown.\u201cELECTROWAVEBABY 2.0 (with Steve Aoki)\u201d: Steve Aoki completely RUINED \u201cELECTROWAVEBABY\u201d! Steve Aoki single-handedly took a great song from the original version of INSANO (the best song, in fact) \u2013 a nuanced, catchy, great pop banger that sampled the club classic \u201cAll That She Wants\u201d by Ace Of Base \u2013 and turned it into a crappy, basic, bland, banal EDM song with predictable drops, loud and rambunctious synths, and sped-up vocals that caused Kid Cudi\u2019s voice to lose all its charm. Absolutely terrible track, and Steve Aoki is entirely to blame for it.\u201cANIMATE (feat. King Chip)\u201d: Kid Cudi & King Chip have gone 2 for 3 on this album with collabs, and I really want to just throw \u201cWILLIS (feat. King Chip)\u201d out because neither artist sounded serious, nor did they sound like they were using their real voices on that track, so on collabs that were actually serious, Kid Cudi & King Chip are 2 for 2 and have made the two best songs on this album so far. The production on this song is fire; it\u2019s a straightforward, to-the-point, lo-fi, laid-back hip-hop beat that Kid Cudi & King Chip just demolish on their verses. Kid Cudi\u2019s first verse is very good, but there are a few lines I don\u2019t like, such as the line, \u201cYou think that I lost my juice, au contraire, my playa,\u201d and whenever Kid Cudi uses a bunch of \u201coo\u201d sounds in a rhyme scheme. The chorus from Kid Cudi is great, though, as it\u2019s not harmonizing, humming, or singing that gets it done on the chorus \u2013 it\u2019s rapping, and very good rapping. The second verse from King Chip is just great; everything about it is fire, but unfortunately, I had to dock a few points for the cringy outro given by Kid Cudi where he does some non-lyric vocals and cringy stuff as the song ends. Great song, though, even despite the cringe outro.\u201cILL WHAT I BLEED\u201d: Production from Kid Cudi, Jean Baptiste, Karl Rubin, and DJ Replay was absolutely fire \u2013 this hard-hitting trap instrumental with a strong drum pattern and psychedelic melody was absolutely perfect for Kid Cudi. However, despite the great production, Kid Cudi fumbled the bag with a cringy, dumb, and bad first verse, a mid chorus where Kid Cudi\u2019s vocals sounded ridiculous and awful, and an average at best second verse where Kid Cudi\u2019s cringy ad-libs were the main problem. Although this song had a lot of potential with its great production, Kid Cudi completely fumbled the bag and turned this great beat into a mid song.\u201cI JUST WANNA GET (with Steve Aoki feat. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony & King Chip)\u201d: As the legendary DJ Khaled would say, Kid Cudi & King Chip are back with \u201cANOTHA ONE\u201d; a third banger collaboration and another of the best songs on this album, but this time, assisted by Steve Aoki on production and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on two feature verses. The production on this song is outstanding; Steve Aoki redeemed himself for the egregious bag fumble that was the crappy EDM remix of \u201cELECTEOWAVEBABY\u201d by teaming up with BNYX\u00ae, Jean Baptiste, Beau Nox, and Kid Cudi for a low-key, laid-back, psychedelic instrumental with an amazingly beautiful vocal sample of a female vocalist saying \u201chigh.\u201d I wish I knew what the sample was, but if I had to give a description of it, I\u2019d say it sounds somewhat like Carly Rae Jepsen, Kylie Minogue, or Imogen Heap singing in a high, crisp, clean voice. This vocal sample serves as a staple on the chorus, as Kid Cudi\u2019s smooth, slow, low-key delivery juxtaposes brilliantly with it for a great chorus. The first verse from Kid Cudi is good, but not great, as there are some bad lines in it and Cudder\u2019s vocal delivery is frequently muddied and unclear. The second verse from Bone Thugs member Krayzie Bone was great, but the third verse from Bone Thugs member Layzie Bone sounded like 90\u2019s R&B singer Montell Jordan trying to rap and over-annunciating his words in the process. Needless to say, it was pretty bad, but it didn\u2019t last very long, which made it tolerable. The fourth verse from King Chip was great, as he knew exactly what he was doing and how to properly support Kid Cudi on this song; giving a great verse that fit the subject of the song and was on par with his performance from \u201cANIMATE (feat. King Chip).\u201d Great song.Kid Cudi opens this album, the deluxe edition for his January 2024 album INSANO (which is supposed to be his swan song, victory lap, final album before he retires) (also, this album is supposedly the first of many deluxe editions for INSANO), with the quote \u201cCaptain Insano shows no mercy,\u201d which Adam Sandler says in The Waterboy. Honestly, I wish Kid Cudi, who is \u201cCaptain Insano\u201d per identification by this quote, would have shown mercy and not released two albums of mediocre material. The first INSANO album was better than this one; there\u2019s no doubt about that, and if that album had been the only one Kid Cudi released, I would have been satisfied. However, Kid Cudi released a total of 39 songs in two months between these two albums, and there are enough good songs between the two albums that a solid 15 track album could\u2019ve been made. Why didn\u2019t Kid Cudi pare down the tracklist and release a 15 track album with a bunch of good songs and only a few mid ones? This album has good songs that should\u2019ve been on the regular INSANO album, but it also has throwaway filler that couldn\u2019t make the cut for INSANO, or any Kid Cudi album for that matter. \u201cDOSE OF DOPENESS (2007)\u201d & \u201cROCKET (2011)\u201d were rejected tracks that kept getting rejected from other Kid Cudi albums, so he felt the need to increase the length of his already long victory lap album by throwing them on this tracklist. There\u2019s a reason these songs kept getting cut from other Kid Cudi albums \u2013 they absolutely sucked. So, why did Kid Cudi put them on this album along with a bunch of other filler? I guess what I\u2019m trying to say with this rambling rant about the two INSANO albums is that there should\u2019ve been one good INSANO album instead of two mid ones with a bunch of filler songs. King Chip was the hero of this album; he went 3 for 4 with features, and the only reason he didn\u2019t go 4 for 4 was because \u201cWILLIS (feat. King Chip)\u201d exists, and that song was likely another reject track that Cudder decided to put on this album to increase the length of the tracklist. King Chip continuously showed up with great verses, even if they were misguided and probably in the wrong song. Kid Cudi was sporadic, inconsistent, and overall mid on this album. Although he had some great choruses and a few great verses here and there, there were more great beats than there were great Kid Cudi performances. Samples from songs like \u201cEnjoy The Silence\u201d by Depeche Mode, \u201cMmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\u201d by Crash Test Dummies, and \u201cAll That She Wants\u201d by Ace Of Base (although it was ruined by Steve Aoki on the garbage remix of \u201cELECTROWAVEBABY\u201d) made for good beats, but without Kid Cudi showing up to take advantage of them, they made for mid songs (however, not in the case of \u201cEnjoy The Silence\u201d by Depeche Mode, as the song was good, but Kid Cudi\u2019s verse was mid on it). None of Kid Cudi\u2019s solo songs on this album were any good, and even when features helped him, such as the feature verses from Wiz Khalifa and Pusha T on their respective songs, Kid Cudi couldn\u2019t show up and take full advantage of them. Ultimately, INSANO was a good enough album for Kid Cudi to retire with despite it being mid (since it accurately reflected his career and had hype narration from DJ Drama that made the album sound like something Kid Cudi could feel comfortable going out on top with), but this album was terrible and is a stain on the legacy of the original INSANO album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released January 12, 2024Genres: Psychedelia, Pop Rap, Art Pop, Trap, Emo, Avant-Garde & ExperimentalTracks:OFTEN, I HAVE THESE DREAMZ (with DJ Drama) \u2013 7.2KEEP BOUNCIN\u2019 \u2013 6.4GET OFF ME (with DJ Drama feat.

Now, I don\u2019t agree with everything he says about him & Kid Cudi \u201cbirthing the sound\u201d and \u201cbirthing the culture,\u201d but DJ Drama certainly succeeded in hyping Kid Cudi up on this song. The mellow, laid-back, lo-fi production supported by a vocal sample and slow, reverbed drums from Mike Zombie, 1993, Jean Baptiste, and Kid Cudi is excellent (and it\u2019s cool to see that Mike Zombie is still producing; I haven\u2019t heard anything from him since Drake\u2019s excellent banger \u201cStarted From The Bottom\u201d), but unfortunately, Kid Cudi fumbled the bag with two mid verses. The verses from Kid Cudi had mid lyrics, a mid flow, and mid vocal delivery. The spoken interlude in between the verses where Kid Cudi talks about a recurring dream he has where he\u2019s falling and then suddenly flying was completely irrelevant and dumb, but I understand why he put it in the song, since it\u2019s very on brand for his psychedelic hip-hop sound. Mid intro track, but it definitely sounds like a Kid Cudi intro.\u201cKEEP BOUNCIN\u2019\u201d: Great production from Honorable C.N.O.T.E. and Kid Cudi on this song; the trap drum pattern and 808 drum pattern mixed with the 808 synth chords and punch-packing 808 bassline made for a great beat that was grounded by its trap drum pattern but nuanced with the various 808s used. The crisp, clear synth melody on the chorus was also a great touch that added so much to the song. However, both verses from Kid Cudi on this track were bad, and his chorus was bad as well. The chorus was repetitive, annoying, and stupid, and both verses had bad lyrics and bad flows. However, Kid Cudi partially redeemed himself on the post-chorus where he gave a great vocal performance where he sounded somewhat like the classic R&B/soul singer Curtis Mayfield. Unfortunately, that great post-chorus doesn\u2019t make up for the bad verses and chorus. Great production, bad performance from Kid Cudi.\u201cGET OFF ME (with DJ Drama feat. Travis Scott)\u201d: Another bombastic, over-the-top, in-your-face spoken intro from DJ Drama on this track, but it\u2019s warranted on this album since it\u2019s probably gonna be Kid Cudi\u2019s final album before he hangs it up, especially when DJ Drama makes claims like \u201cWhat do you call it when your music changes the world? I call that legendary.\u201d Again, I don\u2019t think I agree with him when he says Kid Cudi\u2019s music changed the world, but he\u2019s hyping up Kid Cudi like there\u2019s no tomorrow. The production from Mike Zombie (haven\u2019t heard anything from him in years, now he\u2019s got two production credits almost back to back on this Kid Cudi album), 1993, Jean Baptiste, and Kid Cudi is very good; the synth piano melody is very well executed and the drum pattern is good as well, but yet again, Kid Cudi fails to take full advantage of it. The first verse from Kid Cudi is mid on this track, but luckily, it\u2019s short and the chorus and post-chorus Kid Cudi does are both good. The second verse from Travis Scott is great, and the third verse, which is a group verse from Kid Cudi & Travis Scott, is good. Travis Scott absolutely wipes the floor with his mentor and inspiration Kid Cudi on this track, but Kid Cudi has not been great so far on this album, and to his credit, this Travis Scott collaboration brought out his best performances in the form of the chorus, post-chorus, and third group verse with Travis Scott. Good song.\u201cMOST AIN\u2019T DENNIS\u201d: Okay, I feel like I have to talk about this song because of how absolutely horrible and weird it is. The production on this song is horrendously awful, as it\u2019s guided by a weirdly drawn out and flanged 808 chord progression and some buzzing, chaotic synths that make up some kind of melody, but the worst part of this beat is the fact that it\u2019s produced by BNYX\u00ae, SADPONY, FNZ, and Kid Cudi! Four producers who have shown how good they can be on other artists\u2019 albums repeatedly completely fumbled the bag on this song with this terrible beat. The verses, chorus, and harmonizing / humming from Kid Cudi on this song is all abysmal, as his lyrics suck, his vocals suck, and his flows are trash. It\u2019s unfortunate that these four producers, all of whom have proven their greatness on other songs, completely failed together on this track.\u201cWOW (with DJ Drama feat. A$AP Rocky)\u201d: Great verse from A$AP Rocky on this song; his lyrics, flow, and vocal delivery were all on point (except for two lines where he tried to mimic Kid Cudi\u2019s vocal delivery from the chorus). Unfortunately, while I love this verse from A$AP Rocky, everything Kid Cudi did on this song was absolute garbage. His chorus was annoying, repetitive, childish, and stupid, and his verses were all of those things as well. His lyrics, flows, and vocal delivery all sucked on this song. The production was average at best, so Kid Cudi\u2019s horrible performance got no help from Dot Da Genius, Kid jupiter, and theycallmeParker. Great feature verse from A$AP Rocky, but terrible performance from Kid Cudi that totally brought down the song.\u201cELECTROWAVEBABY\u201d: Wow, what a banger. I never thought Kid Cudi singing (extremely well, I might add) over a modified, deconstructed sample of Ace Of Base\u2019s \u201cAll That She Wants\u201d would be good, but this song was absolutely awesome and undoubtedly the best performance Kid Cudi has had on this album so far. The vocals, humming, harmonizing, and lyrics on this song are all great, and I\u2019ve gotta add that this track would go extremely hard in a club or at a party. BNYX\u00ae totally redeemed himself with this absolutely fire beat (that also shows his incredible range as a producer), and Jean Baptiste & Kid Cudi were cooking right alongside him with this awesome beat. Great song.\u201cCUD LIFE (with DJ Drama)\u201d: Three consecutive solo bangers for Kid Cudi; he\u2019s going on a heater right now. The production from Dot Da Genius, Keyon Christ, Jonnywood, and Kid Cudi on this song is good, but it\u2019s a bit disjointed and weird with its melody, which is a synth melody where some of the notes sound out of key or very awkward. The drum pattern, 808 pattern, and chord progression are all solid on this beat, though, as it sounds like Kid Cudi\u2019s version of a rage rap song. The track somewhat sounds like a diluted version of Travis Scott\u2019s legendary rage banger \u201cFE!N (feat. Playboi Carti & Sheck Wes),\u201d especially in the intro and on parts of the melody. The two verses from Kid Cudi on here are both good, as he sounds like he\u2019s embracing his persona as the party animal rager guy that he created on his second album Man On The Moon II: The Legend Of Mr. Rager, and has continued to cultivate throughout his career. These verses show Kid Cudi confident, assured, and ready to go hard, and while some of his lyrics aren\u2019t great on these verses and his choruses have awkward flows and imperfect lyrics, these kinds of songs are great to hear from Kid Cudi, especially if this album truly is his final one.\u201cAT THE PARTY (feat. Pharrell Williams & Travis Scott)\u201d: Great production from Pharrell Williams on this song; I heard Pharrell\u2019s signature four-count at the beginning of the track and knew that this beat was about to be great, and it definitely was. The chorus from Pharrell Williams was not as good as his production, though. Pharrell Williams\u2019 vocals and flow on the chorus were both average at best, but he made up for it with good lyrics, good ad-libs from Kid Cudi, and the fire sample from \u201cDay N\u2019 Nite (Nightmare)\u201d by Kid Cudi that served as ad-libs on the chorus. The first verse from Kid Cudi is one of his best ones on this album so far, if not his best, as he absolutely went HAM on that verse with great lyrics and flows. The second verse from Travis Scott is great as well; he\u2019s gone 2 for 2 with excellent features on this album. Since this album is probably Kid Cudi\u2019s final album before his retirement, Travis Scott obviously wants to boost the legacy of his mentor and primary musical inspiration, so he\u2019s going all out on this album. Great song, but the chorus from Pharrell could\u2019ve been better.\u201cTORTURED\u201d: Love the production from WondaGurl & CuBeatz, love the vocals & flows from Kid Cudi, hate the lyrics and subject matter. This song is essentially about how Kid Cudi has various issues and problems in his life, but instead of facing them or attempting to deal with them, he drowns his pain and sorrow in drugs. \u201cI'mma stay tortured all my life\u201d is the main takeaway from this song. Kid Cudi has rolled over and accepted the fact that he\u2019s unhappy, and uses drugs as a temporary fix for his mental health issues. That subject matter clashes with everything I advocate for and believe in with my own life. It\u2019s a terrible message and Kid Cudi\u2019s lyrics are absolutely terrible on this song. It\u2019s unfortunate because WondaGurl & CuBeatz were cooking with the production on this song, and the humming, harmonizing, and vocals from Kid Cudi are all good, but the subject matter simply sucks too much for the song to be good.\u201cSEVEN (feat. Lil Wayne)\u201d: The chorus from Kid Cudi could\u2019ve been better, as the opening two lines on each chorus are delivered awkwardly, and Lil Wayne does the chorus way better when he does it as the outro, but it was still good overall. The first verse from Kid Cudi is great, and though there\u2019s a filter vocal effect on Kid Cudi\u2019s voice, he still sounds great and it adds to the psychedelic and trippy sound of this song. It\u2019s also a great contrast to Lil Wayne\u2019s second verse, which is great and has crisp, clear vocals from Weezy. Lil Wayne\u2019s verse has great lyrics and a great flow, but I wish it had been longer. The production from Clams Casino & Take A Daytrip is minimalist, mostly relying on a drum pattern and simple chord progression, but it\u2019s a solid backdrop that gives Kid Cudi & Lil Wayne a lot of room to work. It\u2019s not one of the more ethereal or grandiose instrumentals I\u2019ve heard from Clams Casino, as he\u2019s been responsible for some very gaudy, bombastic, and psychedelic instrumentals in the past, but I think the minimalist route was the way to go on this one. Great song.\u201cBLUE SKY\u201d: I\u2019m a big fan of Kid Cudi making happy, positive music as opposed to his common emo, depressing music he\u2019s been prone to make (the same can be said for any artist, honestly; I\u2019ll always prefer happy & positive music and lyrics to emo & depressing crap), and this song is a great example of why positivity and happiness is an awesome thing for Kid Cudi\u2019s music. The airy, light, upbeat production from Lil Yachty, SADPONY, Justin Raisen (the production team from Lil Yachty\u2019s Let\u2019s Start Here.), Jean Baptiste, and Kid Cudi is very good, and Kid Cudi does an overall good job on this song despite a few bad moments. On his verses, his flows can become awkward and offbeat quite easily, but since his lyrics are very good and his humming usually returns him to the beat, it\u2019s not that big of an issue. The chorus is overflowing with positivity, but I think the vocals, lyrics, and flow could\u2019ve been better on the chorus. This song would\u2019ve been great as the outro track for this album, but regardless, it\u2019s a very good song that shows why Kid Cudi needs to make more positive music.The first album in what could be a multiple album series to close out Kid Cudi\u2019s career. After he released his previous album Entergalactic, Kid Cudi said he was retiring from music, but he quickly amended that statement to say he would release one more album before he retired. This album, along with \u201cseveral additional deluxe editions,\u201d according to Kid Cudi, would be the 40-year-old Cleveland-born artist\u2019s swan song \u2013 his final statement before retirement. He has already delivered on his promise by releasing INSANO (NITRO MEGA) (as of March 1, 2024), with the statement that \u201cmore deluxe editions are on the way).\u201d This album is kind of a mess \u2013 it\u2019s far from perfect, but it does a good job at representing Kid Cudi\u2019s career and his commitment to experimental, off-the-wall, genre-blending music that takes elements of psychedelia, art pop, art rock, hip-hop, trap, and emo music and fuses it into Kid Cudi\u2019s signature style. Kid Cudi has never been a rapper \u2013 in fact, the majority of his songs include more singing and humming than rapping. For better or for worse, Kid Cudi has also inspired a lot of artists in the emo rap subgenre, as artists like Trippie Redd, Juice WRLD, Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, and XXXTENTACION have all cited him as influences, and Kid Cudi has made a point to collaborate with all of them in one way or another. However, I want to continue talking about this album and not Kid Cudi\u2019s influence, which is pretty wide-ranging, much like his musical style. This album is narrated by DJ Drama, who is known for being one of the most well-known and well-respected hypemen in hip-hop, and despite the fact that I often find his bombastic, over-the-top, in-your-face yelling annoying, I thought it was warranted on this album, as Kid Cudi needed someone like DJ Drama to tell people, \u201cHey, I\u2019m retiring, so this is everything I\u2019ve done for music. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d DJ Drama did a great job of doing exactly that with his spoken intros and interludes. An interesting thing about this album was how much trap and rage influences it had. Kid Cudi has never been known for doing trap or rage music on his albums (despite the fact that one of his nicknames is Mr. Rager), so it was interesting to hear him try his hand at those styles on this album. Songs like \u201cGET OFF ME (with DJ Drama feat. Travis Scott),\u201d \u201cA TALE OF A KNIGHT (with DJ Drama),\u201d and \u201cCUD LIFE (with DJ Drama)\u201d were some of the best songs on this album and all had influences from trap and rage music (although, none of these songs sounded like traditional rage rap, as Kid Cudi applied his own sound to them in a way only he can). Kid Cudi produced almost every song on this album, but he collaborated with a wide range of producers on this album\u2019s beats, very few of which he\u2019d previously worked with. Now, Dot Da Genius & Plain Pat still appeared on this album, but their production credits were few and far between. The dominant producers on this album were Jean Baptiste, BNYX\u00ae, SADPONY, Mike Zombie, 1993, and a few others, but those five definitely appeared the most throughout this album. It was cool to hear the results of those collaborations, especially considering BNYX\u00ae\u2019s immense range and versatility as a producer (that dude is incredibly talented) and the work SADPONY, Lil Yachty, and Justin Raisen did on Lil Yachty\u2019s Let\u2019s Start Here.. The features on this album were somewhat panned, as guys like Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky, and Lil Wayne really stepped up and did the most for Kid Cudi on this album, but others, like Lil Yachty, Young Thug, and the posthumous feature from XXXTENTACION, did absolutely nothing for the album. Travis Scott was one of the standouts of this album, though, as he had two features and went absolutely HAM on both of them. He was really showing out for the final album of his mentor and main musical inspiration, and I commend him greatly for that. Overall, this album was hit-and-miss with more misses than hits, but since Kid Cudi is releasing a few more deluxe editions and this album accurately represented his rollercoaster career, I\u2019m glad this album is the one Kid Cudi chooses to retire with.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released February 9, 2024Genres: Synthpop, Pop, Electronic (EDM)Tracks:Can\u2019t Tame Her \u2013 7.2More Than This Was \u2013 5.8On My Love (with David Guetta) \u2013 8.4Ammunition \u2013 4.6None Of These Guys \u2013 4.8You Love Who You Love \u2013 5.4End Of Time \u2013 6Nothing \u2013 4.2Escape \u2013 6.4Soundtrack \u2013 4Venus \u2013 6.6The Healing \u2013 3Reviewer\u2019s Notes: The first pop album I\u2019ve reviewed in 2024 is bad. Zara Larsson has always been a pop star to watch for me, ever since she burst on the scene in 2017 with her debut album So Good, which included great songs like \u201cLush Life,\u201d \u201cI Would Like,\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t My Fault,\u201d all of which were catchy pop bangers that go hard in any situation. So Good is currently the highest rated Zara Larsson album in the review page, but I suspect that will change with a re-review. I\u2019ve listened to the album a few times since the initial review, and it\u2019s not held up, so I imagine it\u2019ll be docked significantly with a re-review. Zara Larsson became even more of a pop star to watch in 2021 with her sophomore album Poster Girl, which included more great pop bangers; features from Young Thug, Julia Michaels, and Sabrina Carpenter; and even held the AOTY title for 2021 for quite a while until Yung BLEU\u2019s excellent debut album Moon Boy took the title. I was really looking forward to hearing this album for three reasons: Zara teased this project as being a concept album about Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty; Danja, a producer with an excellent track record and extensive collaborations with Justin Timberlake & Timbaland, is credited throughout the album; and David Guetta, the master of EDM / synthpop club banger anthems, is credited once on this album. However, I quickly realized Zara Larsson was capping about this album being a concept album about the Roman goddess of love and beauty, but that didn\u2019t really bother me because \u201cCan\u2019t Tame Her\u201d fell short of being good because of mid lyrics, mid vocals, and mid production, but the subject matter was good. The concept about a party girl who can\u2019t be tamed or tied down was a great opener for this album, and while the execution could\u2019ve been better, I was looking forward to hearing an album with those themes. However, that song ended up being the second best track on the album, and after \u201cOn My Love (with David Guetta),\u201d which was hard carried by David Guetta\u2019s excellent production, the album absolutely bombed and found new ways to get worse with every song. Zara limped through the David Guetta collaboration with mid vocals, repetitive lyrics, and bad lyricism overall, and after David Guetta left, this album\u2019s production deteriorated and only got worse. Danja wasn\u2019t cooking at all on this album. The production was lackluster, flavorless, bland, and in limbo between catchy club synthpop and slow \u201cemo sad girl\u201d music. Zara Larsson\u2019s vocals on this album were just bad; much worse than they\u2019ve been on any of her previous albums. One of the reasons I liked Zara\u2019s earlier albums was because of how good her vocals were, but she sounded like a different person on this album, with flat vocals and weird vocal delivery. Lyrics sucked throughout the album, but I think Zara hit her lowest point on \u201cNone Of These Guys,\u201d when she referred to everyone who isn\u2019t her boyfriend as \u201cNPCs.\u201d With her first album in three years, Zara Larsson hits an all-time low that even a re-reviewed So Good won\u2019t come close to being as bad as. If she has another album like this one, she will undoubtedly suffer a fall-off. Let\u2019s hope she gets it together before then because this album is just not it.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released January 12, 2024Genres: Trap, Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop RapTracks:all of me \u2013 9.4redrum \u2013 5.4n.h.i.e. (feat.

Heather Carmillia Joseph)\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201call of me\u201d: The sample of \u201cWishing On A Star\u201d by Rose Royce is a massive W, as the original track is an amazing 70\u2019s R&B/soul song with great vocals, great lyrics, a sweeping violin melody, and a smooth piano melody. In fact, in mid to late 2023, there was a clip circulating around social media of a guy on a morning show who used a sample of this song to create an incredible \u201cchop-up-the-soul\u201d beat that was often compared to Kanye West. The sample choice was a W, but I wish the sample had been used better and more frequently. The transition from the sampled vocals on the intro to those on the chorus (mixed with the trap drums) and the transition from the chorus to the outro were both clunky, clumsy, and awkward, as if the vocal samples were intended for different songs. However, apart from the fact that the sample wasn\u2019t used very well or very frequently, the production on this track is good. The booming 808s kick in at just the right time on the verses, and the drum pattern is very well done. As for 21 Savage\u2019s performance on this song, I\u2019m very impressed with his continued evolution. He\u2019s evolved from a one-trick-pony Atlanta trap rapper who took a backseat to more dynamic rappers like Future & Young Thug to a genuine hip-hop superstar who might even earn the superstar x-factor classification after this album (Future & Young Thug have gotten to that point already, but only because of their years of experience and continued nuance in their music). 21 Savage\u2019s first verse is great, and while his second verse is good at best (the flow is okay, the lyrics are average, and the production doesn\u2019t help him that much on the verse), his chorus was good and quite a powerful statement. Great intro track; looking forward to hearing more.\u201csneaky\u201d: Great production from COUPE; the bell-like synth melody, fast-paced trap drum pattern, and smooth, evenly spaced 808 pattern went together brilliantly on this song, creating a sound that was both energetic and laid-back at the same time. 21 Savage\u2019s chorus was great, his first verse was very good, and his second verse was good. The chorus was infectiously catchy, as 21 Savage talked about keeping his relationship with a side chick on the down low while also letting everyone know not to mess with him in a laid-back and nonchalant way. The first verse\u2019s opening line \u201cBoogers in the chain, yeah, it\u2019s snot\u201d was cringe, but 21 Savage\u2019s ad-lib \u201cmhm\u201d after most of the lines in this verse was fire, the rest of the lyrics on this verse were very good, and the flow was solid. The second verse had a slight decline in flow, lyrical quality, and vocal delivery (especially with the ad-libs), but it was still a good verse. After two complete misses, 21 Savage gets back to form with another great song.\u201cpop ur s*** (with Metro Boomin feat. Young Thug)\u201d: I\u2019m so glad this song wasn\u2019t on either of Metro Boomin\u2019s last albums HEROES & VILLAINS or the Across The Spider-Verse soundtrack album. This song absolutely sucks! The production from Metro Boomin is average, but nowhere near what I\u2019ve come to expect from him. The production is menacing, sinister, and foreboding, as Metro is trying to create an atmosphere of grit and toughness for 21 Savage & Young Thug to rap on, but the melody is weak, the bassline is too loud, and the drum pattern is stagnant. The first verse from 21 Savage starts out promising, as he uses the same flow he used on Metro Boomin\u2019s \u201cUmbrella (feat. Young Nudy & 21 Savage)\u201d from HEROES & VILLAINS, but the verse quickly gets bad with trash lyrics, apathetic flows, and weird vocal delivery. Even Young Thug\u2019s ad-libs on this verse are not good. The first verse is mid at best, and the chorus is just straight up bad. The chorus is just 21 Savage repeating \u201cpop your s\u2014\u201d while Young Thug does subpar ad-libs, and after that, there\u2019s a few useless lyrics that culminate with the horrendous line \u201cIt smell like gas, I think somebody pooped.\u201d The second verse from Young Thug is straight up unfinished, and I know the reason this verse is unfinished is because prosecutors in Young Thug\u2019s RICO case are attempting to use his lyrics against him, but this verse sounds absolutely awful because none of the lines are finished and it\u2019s just a bunch of pauses. The best Young Thug contribution to the song is his outro, where he gives 4 lines of uncensored lyrics, and they\u2019re actually pretty good. Unfortunately, Metro Boomin & 21 Savage failed to show up, and Young Thug had about 50% of his verse removed from the song due to censorship, and none of it made sense.\u201cletter to my brudda\u201d: \u201cAt the end of the day, we be havin\u2019 good hearts / They just be in bad places,\u201d 21 Savage says on the interlude between the two verses he smoothly and poignantly raps on this song. This track is a letter to Young Thug, who has been going through a very public legal battle for his arrest on RICO charges alongside Gunna and other members of the YSL (Young Stoner Life) Records collective. The first verse is absolutely excellent; 21 Savage starts the verse by subtly dissing Gunna for his alleged \u201csnitching\u201d on Young Thug and the other YSL Records members arrested on RICO charges (then again, no one actually knows the ins and outs of Young Thug\u2019s RICO case, so calling Gunna a \u201csnitch\u201d or even getting involved in the legal battle taking place here is a dumb decision for anyone who hasn\u2019t undergone something similar) (in 21 Savage\u2019s case, though, since he knows everyone indicted and has his own legal battles, he can weigh in intelligently and give his thoughts since he has experienced similar things), then transitions into talking about Young Thug and how he understands Thugger\u2019s situation because he has endured similar trials while trying to become a hip-hop superstar and trying to leave behind a troubled past for a life of stardom. It\u2019s a very complex and intricate verse that shows how deeply 21 Savage cares for Young Thug and how mad he is that Thugger is having to go through what he is. The second verse is great as well, as 21 Savage opens up about his past and how hard it has been to leave behind the lifestyle he used to live and how hard it is for him to cope with the tragic deaths of his friends he grew up with. The production on this song from KXVI, G06 Beatz, Paola Barba, and Iilyth (four no-namer producers I\u2019ve never heard of before this track) is incredible, as the poignant piano melody brilliantly matches the tone of this track, and the classic soul vocal sample adds an extra layer of emotion to this song. Absolutely great performance; I love seeing 21 Savage supporting Young Thug and rapping on a classic soul sample beat in the process.\u201cn\u00e9e-nah (with Metro Boomin feat. Travis Scott)\u201d: This album has been hit and miss so far, but unfortunately, someone who had yet to hit his stride so far was Metro Boomin, who dropped two uncharacteristically mid beats on the previous two songs he was credited on. But with the assistance of a brilliantly used sample of Malcolm McLaren\u2019s \u201cAbout Her,\u201d a very well-executed trap drum pattern, and a simple yet driving melody, Metro Boomin absolutely knocks it out of the park with this beat. Metro Boomin returns to form on this song, and over his stellar production, 21 Savage & Travis Scott give slam dunk performances. The first verse from Travis Scott is excellent, as it sees him adopting a grittier, more fast-paced, and more bar-heavy flow than he\u2019s done on the last few features I\u2019ve heard from him, and though he used similar flows on his 2023 AOTY UTOPIA, I associate the flow he used on this verse with his Days Before Rodeo album. The chorus from 21 Savage was great, and his second verse was amazing. Complete with a shout-out to Usher in the form of the line \u201cOh, you Usher now, you givin\u2019 out confessions, huh?\u201d and a very cool reverb effect on the line \u201cReverb with the chopper, it go \u2018Baow\u2019 when it hit\u201d (undoubtedly courtesy of Metro Boomin). This verse was one of the best ones 21 Savage has had so far on this album, and there have been some great ones, so I\u2019m glad this verse was on a track where Metro Boomin & Travis Scott both brought their A games. Great song.\u201cprove it (feat. Summer Walker)\u201d: Man, this song started out so well! The sample of Faith Evans\u2019 \u201cYou Are My Joy (Interlude)\u201d was absolutely awesome and blended so perfectly into this beat, then 21 Savage\u2019s first verse was great with the exception of two lines that were not very good. Instead of singing, rapping melodically, and trying & failing to be Drake like he did on \u201csee the real,\u201d 21 Savage stuck to what he was good at: rapping in a laid-back, smooth yet aggressive, and deep-voiced flow. Instead of rapping about his normal things like guns, street lifestyle, violence, and overall being a savage like his name says, 21 Savage talked about how much he loves his girlfriend and everything he loves about her. It\u2019s a great first verse, but then Summer Walker\u2019s chorus is mid because of bad lyrics and mid vocals, and then 21 Savage\u2019s second verse is mid at best, as trash lines like \u201cNow you a bear, polar / Play with her cat, Doja\u201d dominate that verse, and he loses the smoothness and effortless flow he had on the first verse. Summer Walker finishes the song with another mid chorus before she tries to sing Faith Evans sample and fails at it. Unfortunately, this song\u2019s very good beat and great first verse were spoiled by a mid Summer Walker performance and 21 Savage not being able to finish strong.\u201cjust like me (with Metro Boomin feat. Burna Boy)\u201d: If anybody should be able to successfully blend Afrobeat and trap on a collaboration between 21 Savage and Nigerian singer Burna Boy, it should be the insanely GOATed assemblage of the top 10 all-time GOAT producer Metro Boomin with FNZ & BoogzDaBeast, both of whom have worked extensively with Kanye West. Unfortunately, the production on this song is mid at best; pretty bad, actually, if I\u2019m being brutally honest. The melody is done by a twangy and abrasive banjo, the trap drum pattern is not at all nuanced and often fights with the banjo for space on the track, and the 808 pattern doesn\u2019t match with the melody or the drum pattern. In short, the production is kind of a mess. The intro from Burna Boy got me hyped, as his vocals sounded great on the intro, unfortunately, after that, he never sounded as good. The chorus from Burna Boy was mid, and the post-chorus from 21 Savage was annoying and repetitive. On this song, 21 Savage spent two verses lamenting how women he\u2019s met recently have become just like him, in that they have been using him for clout and have been exhibiting \u201cstreets behavior,\u201d meaning they haven\u2019t been loyal to him. Both verses from 21 Savage on this song are bad, but there is one good line on this song, where 21 Savage in the second verse says \u201cI asked her her body count, she sent the GIF of me & Cole,\u201d which references his collab with J. Cole \u201ca lot (feat. J. Cole).\u201d It\u2019s a pretty great line, but unfortunately, there are some ridiculously bad lines on this track, and no one performs well on here (including the production team).\u201cred sky (feat. Mikky Ekko & Tommy Newport)\u201d: I was really looking forward to hearing how this song would sound because these are two artists in the indie pop genre (Mikky Ekko is somewhat famous for his feature on Rihanna\u2019s slow, emotional ballad \u201cStay (feat. Mikky Ekko),\u201d but he hasn\u2019t been relevant in years), and 21 Savage has never collaborated with anyone remotely related to indie pop before, so I was interested to hear how this song would sound. Unfortunately, this song is absolute garbage. The production from Honorable C.N.O.T.E. sounds like it\u2019s supposed to be the intro to a Marvel movie, and not in a good way. It sounds more like someone added trap drums & 808s to a Brian Tyler song from the film score of The Avengers than it does an actual beat. The instrumental is far too gaudy and overblown, and while Tommy Newport\u2019s intro started out somewhat good, he put too many emo lyrics in it and his vocals quickly declined in quality. As for Mikky Ekko on the chorus, he wasn\u2019t any better, as his vocals were terrible and the lyrics only somewhat made sense. The two verses from 21 Savage were horrifically violent, and I mean that they\u2019re even more violent than anything I\u2019ve heard from 21 Savage before, which is off-putting. He\u2019s essentially talking about doing Game Of Thrones type torture to his opps, while dropping garbage lines like \u201cLive on the toilet, I stay on my s***.\u201d Absolutely trash and horrendously bad song.\u201cdark days (feat. Mariah The Scientist)\u201d: Incredible outro and one of the deepest songs 21 Savage has ever made. The two verses from 21 Savage are absolutely amazing, as he pours his heart out and clears up anything that may have been misleading about his previous songs. This track proves that 21 Savage doesn\u2019t promote murder, gang violence, shooting people up, or any of the things he talks about in his music. Although he may have had to do these things growing up, he implores the people listening to his music to heed his advice. \u201cI know it might sound lame, but just stay in school / They got a place that they keep people who don\u2019t follow rules,\u201d \u201cYeah, you say you love your switch, but it don\u2019t love you back / You can hug that block all night, it ain\u2019t gon' hug you back,\u201d and \u201cProbably why I tell the kids to put the guns down\u201d are just a few of the lines he drops on this song that implore people not to fall victim to the lifestyle 21 Savage lived growing up if they can avoid it. His primary claim on this song: I was able to emerge from the darkest, most violent, and most depressing part of Atlanta to become a hip-hop superstar, but I\u2019m a special case, and many people either end up dead or in prison. He also voices his disdain for prosecutors attempting to use Young Thug\u2019s lyrics against him in court, rebelling by saying he\u2019ll still tell his truth in his music. R&B / pop singer Mariah The Scientist was excellent on this track; her vocals sounded like a combination of Meg Donnelly & SZA, which was a perfect complement to 21 Savage\u2019s introspective flow and the solemn nature of the production (especially the pitched-down vocal sample that said \u201cI need you\u201d). Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better outro, great work by 21 Savage & Mariah The Scientist on here.Although it\u2019s the third album I\u2019m doing in 2024, this album was the first release by a major artist in the new year (coinciding with Kid Cudi\u2019s supposed retirement album INSANO that was also released on January 12, 2024). 21 Savage technically hasn\u2019t released a solo album since i am > i was in 2018, but the reason I say technically is because he dropped SAVAGE MODE II with Metro Boomin in 2020. Both of those albums need to get re-reviewed, but that\u2019s besides the point. It\u2019s been 4 years since the last 21 Savage album where he was the headlining artist, and american dream represents his triumphant return as an artist. The album\u2019s title and some of its lyrics capitalize on the fact that 21 Savage emigrated from the U.K. to the U.S. when he was 7 years old. This album is very hit-and-miss, and I\u2019ve gotta say I was hoping for more from 21 Savage. Whether I want to admit it or not, 21 Savage became a hip-hop superstar x-factor when he released Her Loss with Drake in 2022. This album is supposed to be his first release since achieving the stardom enjoyed by other superstar x-factors in hip-hop like Drake, Travis Scott, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug, Future, Lil Wayne, JAY-Z, and a few others. There were some definite bangers on this album. \u201call of me,\u201d \u201csneaky,\u201d and \u201cletter to my brudda\u201d were all examples of 21 Savage getting it done on his own, albeit in different ways every time. \u201call of me\u201d was a bombastic intro track where 21 Savage rapped on a modified soul sample in trap beat form and went HAM to put everyone on notice that he wasn\u2019t playing around with this album. \u201csneaky\u201d was a catchy trap banger where 21 Savage rapped about keeping a side relationship on the down-low. Lastly, \u201cletter to my brudda\u201d showed 21 Savage coming to the defense of Young Thug and airing his grievances with the legal system and Gunna over a classic soul sample beat. \u201cn\u00e9e-nah (with Metro Boomin feat. Travis Scott)\u201d showed the greatness of Metro, Travis, and 21 Savage when they team up on a track once again, which I\u2019ve seen time and time again on albums from all three artists, so I\u2019m glad to see that they can still get the job done. \u201cdark days (feat. Mariah The Scientist)\u201d was a definite dark horse, but one of 21 Savage\u2019s deepest and most introspective songs I\u2019ve heard from him, which was absolutely awesome and made for an incredible outro. Now that I\u2019ve talked about the good songs on this album, let\u2019s talk about the plethora of bad stuff. Metro Boomin really let me down on this album. Of course, the greatness of his hit with 21 Savage & Travis Scott can\u2019t be understated, but on other collabs, like those with Young Thug, Lil Durk, and Burna Boy, Metro Boomin made shockingly mid beats, even with the assistance of all-star producers. 21 Savage\u2019s hits were great, but some of the songs on this album had egregiously bad bars, cringe lyrics that were difficult to listen to, and excessive violence that crossed the line multiple times, even by 21 Savage standards. I appreciate 21 Savage trying to do some new stuff and expand his audience, like the collabs with Doja Cat, Brent Faiyaz, and Burna Boy, but all of those collabs turned out to be flops of epic proportions where 21 Savage sounded outside his element and uncomfortable. Overall, a third of an album being good isn\u2019t gonna be enough for 21 Savage as a superstar x-factor.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released February 9, 2024Genres: Drill, Trap, Hip-Hop/RapTracks:Who Knew \u2013 7.6No Love (feat.

Vory)\u201d: After a hit-and-miss performance on the intro track (where Fivio Foreign\u2019s main problem was his constant repetition of \u201cwho knew\u201d on the chorus), Fivio Foreign bounces back with a good verse on this song. The first verse from Fivio Foreign on this song was good, but there were a few bad lines that kept it from being great (\u201cIf I gotta problem, I call up my Africans / He got deported, but he made it back again\u201d is probably the worst line in his verse). Unfortunately, the second verse from Vory was mid. I was really looking forward to hearing Vory on this track because he\u2019s an amazing singer and melodic rapper who usually knocks it out of the park on features (and he hyped his verse up with ad-libs saying \u201cNo love lost\u201d at the beginning of the song), but his verse had bad lyrics, a mid flow where Vory frequently got off the beat, and vocals that sounded good but were out of place with this awkward flow. Unfortunately, the second ever collab between Fivio & Vory was mid.\u201cTrauma (feat. Lil Tjay)\u201d: Great production from Non Native & Bordeaux on this song; the downtempo, sultry, delicate pop vocal sample and saxophone breaks mixed with the slow trap drum pattern was a great idea for this track. Unfortunately, this song is the only one on the album that Non Native & Bordeaux, two producers who were credited frequently on Fivio Foreign\u2019s debut album B.I.B.L.E., produced, but if they produced any track, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s this one. Fivio Foreign\u2019s first verse was great, but Lil Tjay\u2019s second verse and chorus were both okay at best. Lil Tjay\u2019s singing voice sounded raspy, gravelly, and apathetic, as if he was trying too hard to sing in a sad voice and ended up just singing badly. His flow and vocal delivery on his verse were mid, as he sounded apathetic and bored on the verse despite lyrics that were actually pretty good. Lil Tjay may not have done a good job on a beat that sounded like it could\u2019ve been right up his alley, but Fivio Foreign came through, so the track ended up being good overall.\u201cCould It Be (feat. Swae Lee)\u201d: This song is just not it. There was a time when every feature Swae Lee did was gold, but that time is unfortunately not 2024. Swae Lee even further cemented Rae Sremmurd\u2019s fall off (which happened with the release of their 2023 flop album Sremm 4 Life) with his feature on this song; his chorus was bad, his verse was terrible (he can\u2019t rap on a drill beat, which he proved on Rae Sremmurd\u2019s Sremm 4 Life album and proved again with this verse), his vocals were bad and off-key (especially his backing vocals which went terribly with this mid production), and his lyrics sucked. Swae Lee was bad on this song, and Fivio Foreign wasn\u2019t any better. Both of Fivio Foreign\u2019s verses had bad lyrics and mid flows, and the production on this song was extremely mid. The drill drum pattern was basic, bland, and contrived, and the vocal sample was poorly executed and blended terribly with Swae Lee\u2019s backing vocals. Swae Lee\u2019s time as a cheat code feature has expired, and as much as it pains me to say it, Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi need to both hang it up.\u201cSame 24 (feat. Meek Mill)\u201d: On a soulful, laid-back, low-key, fire instrumental guided by a piano melody, lo-fi drums, and a classic soul vocal sample produced by Lala The DJ & Saint Cardona, Fivio Foreign gives one of his all-time best verses that shows his immense versatility and ability to rap in a different flow on a classic hip-hop beat that\u2019s not a drill beat. The first verse by Fivio Foreign on this track is unreal. The flow he\u2019s using sounds like a flow Drake, Kanye West, JAY-Z, or Kendrick Lamar would use on a serious, introspective track where they\u2019re looking back on their lives and talking about the struggles they had to endure to get to where they are now. That\u2019s exactly what Fivio Foreign is talking about on this verse, and it\u2019s one of his best verses ever. The flow is amazing, the lyrics are impeccable, and even the second verse from Meek Mill is great as well. Meek Mill did a great job rapping about similar things to what Fivio Foreign was rapping about, but through his own lens and talking about his own life. Honestly, I wish Rick Ross had been on this song because he would\u2019ve been awesome on this beat and a verse from him with the same subject matter as Fivio & Meek\u2019s verses would\u2019ve been epic. If that had been the case, this song could\u2019ve ended up on Meek Mill & Rick Ross\u2019 collab album Too Good To Be True and given it a much-needed rating boost. Amazing song; I hope to hear more tracks like this one from Fivio in the future.\u201cGet Deady (feat. 41 (Kyle Richh, Jenn Carter & TaTa))\u201d: Shout out AyoAA \u2013 This song has one of the best, most layered, most complex, and most put-together Jersey Club beats I\u2019ve ever heard in my life \u2013 excellent production from AyoAA. However, despite the incredible production, Fivio Foreign and Brooklyn-based drill group 41 (not affiliated with Alvin Kamara, the New Orleans Saints RB who wears number 41), a group that consists of Kyle Richh, Jenn Carter & TaTa, underperformed on this song. Fivio Foreign\u2019s first verse started off very well, as he dropped some of his signature lines and applied his flow well to the Jersey Club / drill beat produced masterfully by AyoAA, but once he started ending his lines with words ending in \u201cy\u201d or \u201cie,\u201d it got very cringe very fast, and Fivio was not able to recover, even with the fire line \u201cShe fell in love, shorty is clumsy.\u201d The second and third verses from Kyle Richh & TaTa, two members of 41, were both mid at best, as both rappers had flows that were way too aggressive and had trash lyrics. The best verse on the song was Jenn Carter with the fourth verse, but even he faltered and failed to be better than good at best, as his vocal delivery was not good despite some fire lines and a solid flow. Overall, this great production from AyoAA was wasted by some subpar performances.\u201cThe Best (feat. Popcaan)\u201d: A second consecutive song that\u2019s been a dark horse good track. The last song, \u201cWaiting (feat. Sheff G),\u201d was an unorthodox drill club hit song with a weird beat where Sheff G & Fivio Foreign were both trying to get a party started and daring their opps to try something, but Sheff G, sounding like 50 Cent, did an excellent job and Fivio Foreign did a good job as well, so it was overall good. With this song, AyoAA successfully mixed drill with dancehall to create a great beat with a tropical sound that both Fivio Foreign & Popcaan were comfortable on. This song is a smoother, slower, and more sexually charged track than any of the other tracks I\u2019ve heard so far, but Popcaan did a great job with his first verse and the chorus. His smooth, sultry, sensual vocals were great and his lyrics were awesome as well. The second verse from Fivio Foreign started with him imitating Popcaan\u2019s Jamaican accent, so I thought this track would for sure be an L, but fortunately, he quickly abandoned that and talked about everything he was gonna do to his girl in a surprisingly smooth and cool flow. The only bad part of the song was Popcaan\u2019s third verse, which was complete and total cringe with bad lyrics, an offbeat flow, and terrible vocal delivery. However, the bad third verse doesn\u2019t change the fact that this song was very good and a great display of Fivio Foreign\u2019s versatility.After only two album reviews in 2024, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s VULTURES 1 collab album has been forced to bow to Fivio Foreign for the title of temporary AOTY of 2024, thankfully. Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s VULTURES 1 was a mess shrouded in controversy and anti-Semitism, so I\u2019m glad to say that album no longer holds the title for best album I\u2019ve reviewed in 2024. I don\u2019t think this album is as good as Fivio Foreign\u2019s debut album B.I.B.L.E. (which was executive produced by Kanye West and featured many artists and producers who worked closely with Kanye on Donda and its sequel Donda 2), but it\u2019s still pretty good. Fivio Foreign went 4 for 10 on this album, earning his only 10 on the standout banger \u201cSame 24 (feat. Meek Mill),\u201d where Fivio & Meek Mill rapped about the difficulties and struggles they faced while trying to become rap stars, and the struggles they still face that carry over from their past. The production from Lala The DJ & Saint Cardona was a classic hip-hop beat with a soul vocal sample and piano melody, which was epic and showed that Fivio can rap on any beat, not just drill beats. The other good songs on this album were \u201cThe Best (feat. Popcaan),\u201d a dark horse that earned a 9.2 with Popcaan\u2019s infectiously good first verse and chorus paired with a smooth and delicate second verse from Fivio (as well as an excellent fusion of drill and dancehall by AyoAA); \u201cWaiting (feat. Sheff G),\u201d an unorthodox drill club banger where Sheff G sounded like 50 Cent in his prime by delivering a get-up-and-go chorus and a great verse, while Fivio let himself be outdone by delivering a verse that was only good; and \u201cTrauma (feat. Lil Tjay),\u201d where B.I.B.L.E. producers Non Native & Bordeaux ran it back with Fivio and produced an awesome drill beat with a great pop vocal sample and saxophone flourish that Fivio did really well on, but Lil Tjay was average at best on. Unfortunately, Fivio fumbled the bag with an excellent Jersey Club beat produced by AyoAA on \u201cGet Deady (feat. 41 (Kyle Richh, Jenn Carter & TaTa)),\u201d where his verse and the verses from drill group 41 were all not good, and the collab with Vory was derailed by a subpar performance from the Houston singer / rapper. Overall, this album has its moments and a few good songs, but it\u2019s ultimately not as good as B.I.B.L.E. and only average.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released February 10, 2024Genres: Pop Rap, Electronic (EDM), Hip-Hop/Rap, Rage, Trap, Avant-Garde & ExperimentalTracks:STARS \u2013 2KEYS TO MY LIFE (feat.

His previous lowest-rated song was \u201cMr. Miyagi (feat. Future & Playboi Carti)\u201d from the unreleased, unfinished, and unpolished Donda 2, which was rated 2.4/10, but this song, the first track on Kanye West\u2019s first album since his antisemitic comments in December of 2022 on Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars that effectively killed his career, is now Kanye West\u2019s worst song of all time. This song is absolutely terrible. The vocal sample from indie singer Dijon, which is a repetition of \u201cI hope he\u2019s bright and big and strong,\u201d sounds gaudy, falsely grandiose, pompous, and downright stupid, as Dijon\u2019s vocals are just bad. The first verse from Kanye West starts with him saying \u201cPullin\u2019 up, drop-top Porsche-y\u201d in an extremely cringy manner, and reaches its lowest point with him saying \u201cKeep a few Jews on the staff now.\u201d I\u2019m honestly flabbergasted by the audacity of Kanye to put that line in this song. For the past year and a half, Kanye has alienated himself from pretty much everybody in the music industry with his antisemitism and close alignment with alt-right figures like Alex Jones & Nick Fuentes, and now, it\u2019s culminated in the opening verse of the intro track to his 2024 Ty Dolla $ign collab album. This verse is terrible, cringe, and downright difficult to listen to. The second verse from Ty Dolla $ign is absolutely abysmal, as he sings in a high-pitched falsetto for most of the time, repeats the same four lines twice, says \u201cwoo-woo-woo-woo\u201d at the end of each of his repeated lines for no reason, and just completely cringes it up. It was hard for Ty Dolla $ign to do any worse than Kanye West did with that opening verse, but he did at least equally as bad with one of the worst verses in the history of his career. Ty Dolla $ign is a very good artist, and the albums I\u2019ve listened to from him have all been solid, as his ability to blend smooth R&B, pop rap, and West Coast hip-hop with his own style and swag has always been very appealing to me, but the fact that he\u2019s hitched himself to Kanye\u2019s wagon could be his downfall. All I know is that Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign both hit career-lows with this opening track.\u201cKEYS TO MY LIFE (feat. India Love)\u201d: It absolutely breaks my heart that a collaboration between two top 10 all-time GOAT producers, Kanye West & Timbaland, with two verses from Kanye (one in which he shouts out Timbaland) and a chorus from Ty Dolla $ign, is one of Kanye West\u2019s worst songs of all time. I\u2019m two tracks in on this album and Kanye has already made two songs that are in his bottom 5 of all time. Based on these first two songs, this album could be the most pitiful dip in quality for any artist ever, but I\u2019ll hold off on that claim until I\u2019ve heard the whole thing. The production from Kanye West, Timbaland, and three no-namer producers (including SHD\u00d8W, who was also on the production credits for the intro track) has a garbage vocal sample; synths that sound like an unfinished, unpolished, and bargain-brand version of \u201cSay You Will,\u201d Kanye West\u2019s classic 808s & Heartbreak intro; a drum pattern that sounds unfinished and offbeat; and piano chords that come in at weird times and don\u2019t fit the rest of the beat. Probably one of the worst beats from Kanye West or Timbaland, if not the worst beat from both of them. The first verse from Kanye is bad, as his lines like \u201cPlus, these texts gettin\u2019 way too emoji-nal,\u201d and \u201cHow dare you got a man in my house eatin\u2019 Papa John\u2019s\u201d are cringy, weird, and just flat out stupid. The chorus from Ty Dolla $ign is awful, as he\u2019s completely off-key with his singing and off-beat with his flow. The second verse from Kanye is flat-out terrible, as his lyrics are even worse, cringier, stupider, and weirder than they are in the first verse (\u201cIn a Benzy with a Gen-Z gettin\u2019 gentle\u201d is probably the most egregious line, but there are some other really bad ones). The outro from singer India Love is terrible, as her vocals are raspy, grainy, forced, and just plain terrible. She\u2019s not a good singer, and there\u2019s not much I can say to dress that up. This song is awful.\u201cPAID\u201d: Great club banger production with hard, bass-heavy, danceable drums and a great Jodeci vocal sample. The production, handled by Kanye West, Anthony Kilhoffer (who also worked on Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFade (feat. Post Malone & Ty Dolla $ign),\u201d which this song\u2019s drum pattern and production are very similar to), Wax Motif, Chrishan, and KAYTRANADA, is great on this track, and I think if this song had been a solo Ty Dolla $ign song, it very well could\u2019ve been a 10. Ty Dolla $ign had an excellent performance on this track; his chorus of \u201cI\u2019m just here to get paid\u201d with intermittent harmonizing was pure gold, and his second verse was great. Ty did an amazing job on this song, and the sample from former Seattle Seahawks RB Marshawn \u201cBeast Mode\u201d Lynch from his \u201cI\u2019m only here so I don\u2019t get fined\u201d interview was legendary as well. However, Kanye West was terrible on this track. He started his verse in a high-pitched, ridiculous-sounding vocal cadence, abandoned it, went back to it later, then abandoned it again in favor of high-pitched screaming vocals. Kanye used lyrics from The Police\u2019s classic banger \u201cRoxanne\u201d on his verse, but I have no idea why (maybe because Drake did something similar with Pet Shop Boys\u2019 \u201cWest End Girls\u201d on For All The Dogs), and the vocal cadence he adopted sounded like he was doing an impersonation of Drake impersonating Playboi Carti. Kanye West\u2019s first verse is absolutely trash, and it\u2019s the reason this song is mid. Ty Dolla $ign and the production pulled through on here, though.\u201cTALKING (feat. James Blake & North West)\u201d: Kanye West\u2019s 10-year-old daughter North West is rapping on a Jersey Club beat for the first half of this song. Her verse is extraordinarily \u201cgoofy aah,\u201d and it\u2019s even worse than Drake\u2019s son Adonis\u2019 outro on \u201cDaylight (feat. Adonis Graham).\u201d The chorus, sampled from a cheerleading squad\u2019s chant and an unreleased James Blake song, is terrible as well, as it\u2019s two completely different moods poorly juxtaposed and doesn\u2019t work at all with the Jersey Club beat. The second half of the song has a completely different beat and different sound, and it includes a verse and chorus from Ty Dolla $ign. The production from Kanye West, No I.D., DJ Camper, and James Blake on this section is absolutely horrendous, as the snare-heavy drum pattern is off-putting and in a weird time signature that doesn\u2019t match Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s flow or the melody. The chorus from Ty is bad, as the lyrics are bad, the vocals are mid, and the flow is terrible (in part because of the awful production, but also because Ty Dolla $ign sucks with his vocals on here), and his verse is bad as well. Ty talks about his struggles in being a father on this verse, and while the subject matter is good, nothing else is. Lyrics, vocals, and flow are all terrible on this verse. The outro, which is Kanye singing Ty\u2019s chorus while Ty harmonizes in the background, is poorly executed and shows a decline in Kanye\u2019s singing ability from his previous albums. Horrible song, another of Kanye & Ty\u2019s worst from their individual discographies.\u201cBACK TO ME (feat. Freddie Gibbs & Quavo)\u201d: Despite the Avengers being assembled on production on this song: Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, 88-Keys, Wax Motif, AyoAA, and Nic Nac; the beat on this song is average at best. The drum pattern is consistent and constant throughout the track, but it is not complex and it is the main facet of this beat. If the drum pattern had a bit more nuance, it could be the main focus of this beat, but honestly, these drums can\u2019t carry this instrumental. The pitched-down and chopped Ty Dolla $ign chorus and the Run-DMC \u201crock\u201d vocal samples are both used poorly and don\u2019t contribute hardly anything to the song. The chorus from Ty Dolla $ign is average at best; there are some good harmonies and the flow is solid, but the lyrics are bad and the vocals are mid. The first verse from Kanye West on here is definitely his best verse on the album so far, but it\u2019s still mid. It\u2019s mostly carried by the Quavo ad-libs (why did they take Quavo\u2019s verse off this song?) and the fact that it\u2019s short enough that Kanye can\u2019t say anything too cringe. However, he ups the cringe factor massively on the second verse by repeating in excessive, obnoxious auto-tune \u201cBeautiful, butt-naked, big-titty women just don\u2019t fall out the sky, you know? / And now you know / Oh, now you know\u201d for two straight minutes. Absolutely garbage and abhorrent, and it doesn\u2019t help that the spoken vocal sample from a comedian who sounds like blink-182\u2019s lead singer Mark Hoppus, but whinier and more emo, assists him in this repetition. The third verse from Freddie Gibbs was good; it sort of reminded me of Pusha T\u2019s verse on Kanye\u2019s \u201cRunaway (feat. Pusha T),\u201d in that Freddie Gibbs brought lyrics about cocaine and drug-dealing into a song about a botched relationship, but it was the bargain-brand version of that verse at best. There were some good lines and Freddie Gibbs had a good flow, but overall, the production was not good and Freddie echoed the L themes Kanye introduced on the previous verse. Another bad song.\u201cDO IT (feat. Nipsey Hussle & YG)\u201d: Excellent production on this West Coast hip-hop club anthem from Kanye West, Mustard, Wheezy, CuBeatz & Chrishan. This beat might be the best one so far on the album. The only strike against it is the beat switch going into YG\u2019s third verse, as it wasn\u2019t really necessary and YG\u2019s verse would\u2019ve been better with the original beat that Ty & Kanye had already rapped on. The intro is given by Nipsey Hussle, where he sets the scene by detailing what he\u2019s gonna do to his woman in the bedroom. This intro is good at best; nothing special, but it\u2019s a cool tribute to a West Coast hip-hop legend and sets up the track well. The chorus from Ty Dolla $ign is average at best, as he fails to match the production\u2019s energetic club atmosphere with lethargic vocals and an apathetic flow. This apathy continues into Ty\u2019s verse, where he gives a mid performance with mid lyrics. The second verse from Kanye West isn\u2019t one of his worse ones; it\u2019s actually not terrible, but it\u2019s average at best, as he has some cringe lines and pretty much says whatever (he doesn\u2019t fit the theme of the song with his lyrics). The third verse from YG is average, as he has some cringe lines, all of which are vulgar metaphors for sex that are just weird and unnecessary, but his flow is solid and his lyrics are pretty good for the most part. Probably the best track I\u2019ve heard so far on this album, but mostly because of the production and because Kanye didn\u2019t do anything too egregious with his lyrics, vocals, or flows on this song. Nothing too special, mid.\u201cPAPERWORK (feat. Quavo)\u201d: Assisted by DJ Vitinho Beat & DJ Roca, Kanye West & Digital Nas create an extremely aggressive, abrasive, and industrial Brazilian club beat. The production on this song is reminiscent of Kanye West\u2019s Yeezus, as the loud, abrasive, and industrial sounds take over this track, which makes it difficult to listen to at times. The first verse from Kanye is bad, as the opening lines are offbeat with bad lyrics, and the closing lines are just repetition of \u201cBack on that for the paper.\u201d The only thing that makes this verse slightly good is the ad-libs from Quavo. The verse transitions into a break of the word \u201cbunda\u201d repeated over and over again, which is the Portuguese word for a$$. The second verse from Ty Dolla $ign is bad; he doesn\u2019t even sound like he\u2019s trying with the lazy vocals, trash lyrics, and apathetic flow he has on this verse. The third verse from Quavo is undoubtedly the best one on the song, but it\u2019s average. The lyrics at the beginning of the verse are good, the ad-libs are fire, and the harmonizing is very well done, but the repetition at the end of the verse sucks and Quavo has been known to give features that are much better than this one. All things considered, this song is bad and I expected more.\u201cBURN\u201d: Smooth, rhythmic production from Kanye West, Chrishan, The Legendary Traxster, and Leon Thomas III that plays to Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s strengths as a soulful R&B singer. Ty Dolla $ign takes full advantage of this production by delivering a great chorus with great vocals, sultry lyrics, and a smooth flow. The verse from Kanye West on this track is undoubtedly his best one on the song, as his flow is great and he sounds like he\u2019s rapping on one of his early albums, but the verse is only good because Kanye drops a questionable line at the end of the verse: \u201cMan, the world gone mad / I heard R. Kelly in the next Balenciaga ad.\u201d Not to mention that he starts the verse with \u201cWho\u2019s not entertained by my pain?.\u201d Although this song is meant to be smooth and sultry, as Kanye recruited R&B producer Leon Thomas III, who is known for his smooth beats on albums by Drake, Ariana Grande, and Justine Skye, Kanye takes a very standoff-ish approach to his verse, coming out on the attack and not earning any points with me for it. He also intrudes on Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s chorus multiple times. Let Ty cook, Kanye! It\u2019s the least you can do after ruining a few of the other songs where he had good performances. Overall, though, this song is a W because it\u2019s the first good track on the album.\u201cFUK SUMN (feat. Playboi Carti & Travis Scott)\u201d: Talk about assembling the Avengers. Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti, and Travis Scott with production from Kanye West, Timbaland, Digital Nas, AyoAA, Chrishan, and JPEGMAFIA. That is an absolutely insane lineup! I never thought I\u2019d get to hear a collab between Kanye & Travis with Timbo on production, but then again, I never thought I\u2019d hear a song where Timbo was producing for Carti or JPEGMAFIA was producing for Travis, but here we are. The production on this song is fire; the heavy bass, the Dirty South hip-hop vocal sample, the haunting and foreboding chords: They all make this song sound like it\u2019s the antithesis of Travis Scott\u2019s rage anthem \u201cFE!N (feat. Playboi Carti & Sheck Wes),\u201d but that it could also be the sequel to it. The chorus from Ty Dolla $ign is straightforward and to the point, and his half menacing, half sultry vocal delivery is perfect for it. The best part of the song is Playboi Carti\u2019s post-chorus and first verse, though, as Carti uses the deep voice vocal cadence he had on Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cFE!N (feat. Playboi Carti & Sheck Wes),\u201d and it makes for a great verse. However, Kanye steps in for the bridge after Ty\u2019s second chorus and completely ruins the song with an Alvin-and-the-Chipmunks-aah pitched-up vocal effect. What was he thinking? It sounded so dumb. Kanye\u2019s second verse is great, though, (so it kind of makes up for the egregious Chipmunk-aah vocals) as his flow is great, his lyrics are very good, and he returns to a form in which he\u2019s not rapping about anything politically or racially charged. The third verse from Travis Scott is somewhat disappointing, though, as it\u2019s too short and average at best. The lyrics are good, but Travis' vocal delivery is uninspired and his flow is weak, which are two things unacceptable on a good rage song. I never in a million years would\u2019ve thought the best part of a collab between Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti, and Travis Scott would be Playboi Carti, though, hats off to him for an excellent performance, and hats off to Ty Dolla $ign for getting way outside his comfort zone and doing well. Best song on the album so far, but not great.\u201cVULTURES (feat. Bump J & Lil Durk)\u201d: The title track and first single released from this album. The production from Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Wheezy, Fya Man, Ojivolta, and a few no-namer producers is both gritty and grandiose, which is a great mix for the track being that it allows Kanye to be outlandish and dramatic while having Chicago drill rappers Bump J & Lil Durk rap about their violent street lifestyles before rap (in fact, Bump J was a frequent Kanye collaborator in the early 2000\u2019s before he was imprisoned for 10 years on bank robbery charges). The first verse from Bump J is mid at best, as his flow is apathetic, uninspired, and bland, his lyrics are mid, and his vocals are so bland and flavorless that it sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to be on the song. The second verse from Lil Durk is definitely the best on the track, but it\u2019s nothing extremely special. It\u2019s good, as Lil Durk\u2019s flow, lyrics, and vocal delivery over the gritty drum pattern and grandiose chord progression are all good, but he took a few lines to hit his stride, and when he finally started finding his footing (the last line of the verse \u201cOffset with this Cuban Link, you think she was Cardi,\u201d is definitely the best one), Kanye took over and absolutely crapped all over the song. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I f***ed last night, I got Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d \u201cHow I\u2019m Anti-Semitic? I just f\u2014ed a Jewish b\u2014-,\u201d and \u201cThis ain\u2019t Columbine, but we came in with the trenches\u201d are more than enough to show why this verse is one of Kanye\u2019s all-time worst verses and show that Kanye is off his rocker. Absolutely horrific display, even with a name drop of my favorite NBA player Jimmy Butler. Ty Dolla $ign isn\u2019t much better on this song; his verse isn\u2019t quite as awful as Kanye\u2019s, but it\u2019s extremely close to being as bad. The two lines that show how awful this verse is: \u201cShe want me to put some of this coke in her butt / She Russian, I beat that p\u2014- up for Ukraine.\u201d The outro, sampled from 2 Eleven, a Dirty South / Memphis rage hip-hop artist, is alright, but the true best moment of the song comes after, as the gritty Dirty South sample transitions into a sweeping violin chord progression that serves as the song\u2019s outro. It reminded me of one of MIKE DEAN\u2019s legendary synth outros; very well done. Unfortunately, the rest of the song is complete and utter garbage, with the exception of Lil Durk\u2019s verse.\u201cCARNIVAL (feat. Rich The Kid & Playboi Carti)\u201d: The new worst Kanye West (and worst Ty Dolla $ign) song of all time. The verses from Rich The Kid & Kanye West on this song are worse than anything that was said by either Kanye or Ty Dolla $ign on the previous song \u201cVULTURES (feat. Bump J & Lil Durk).\u201d The production on this song from Kanye West, Ojivolta, Digital Nas, and frequent Rich The Kid collaborator TheLabCook absolutely sucks, as it\u2019s essentially massively loud bass boosts and distorted guitar riffs mixed with a choir chorus where the choir (in some sort of foreign accent) recites the lines \u201cHead so good, she honor roll / She ride the d*** like a carnival / I done did the impossible,\u201d which is one of the worst choruses I\u2019ve ever heard and might be the worst chorus on this album. The first verse from Rich The Kid, who had completely fallen off before this song had been released, as I hadn\u2019t heard anything from him since 2021, is absolutely awful, as he essentially echoes everything Kanye said on his verse from \u201cVULTURES (feat. Bump J & Lil Durk),\u201d while putting his own terrible spin on it with awful lyrics and a terrible flow that sounds like many of his other songs (where the flow usually works, but it definitely didn\u2019t work on this song). The second verse from Ty Dolla $ign has trash lyrics and a garbage flow, making it terrible, but Kanye West outdoes himself with the cringe and ridiculous lines on this song. The lines \u201cAnybody pissed off, gotta make \u2018em drink the urine / Now I\u2019m Ye-Kelly, b\u2014-, now I\u2019m Bill Cosby, b\u2014- / Now, I\u2019m Puff Daddy rich, that\u2019s Me Too rich,\u201d \u201cShe gon\u2019 take it up the a$$ like a ventriloquist,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m the new Jesus, b\u2014-\u201d are enough to explain why this song is another of Kanye\u2019s all-time worst verses. The final verse from Playboi Carti has the same flow he used in the earlier feature he had on this album, where he\u2019s rapping in a deep vocal cadence, but this verse is mid at best, as the lyrics aren\u2019t good, the vocal delivery is poor, and the flow gets messed up by the trash production. Absolutely awful song, definitely the worst in either Kanye or Ty\u2019s catalog.\u201cBEG FORGIVENESS (feat. Chris Brown)\u201d: Best song on the album as of now, and I don\u2019t see this song getting topped by anything else. The production on this song from Kanye West, London On Da Track, Digital Nas, JPEGMAFIA, and SHD\u00d8W is absolutely amazing. The first section is a minimalist Jersey Club beat with the signature Jersey Club 808 drum pattern, but slowed down and hit with reverb to give the song a downtempo, laid-back, and low-key sound, which it definitely succeeded in doing. The second section is another minimalist beat, but this one is completely reliant on the vocal sample chops from the choir\u2019s reiteration of the line \u201cbeg forgiveness,\u201d which creates a half foreboding, half hopeful sound for the song. I can now understand why people were so hyped about JPEGMAFIA being a producer on this album; between this beat and \u201cFUK SUMN (feat. Playboi Carti & Travis Scott),\u201d he\u2019s been a part of some pretty awesome beats. The first section almost exclusively features Chris Brown, who starts singing in his normal voice, but eventually has it pitched down to deliver his gospel-esque lyrics throughout this part. I didn\u2019t like the pitching down of Chris' voice; I wish he had sung the entire song in his normal voice. The performance was still good, but it could\u2019ve been better if he\u2019d sung in his normal voice. The first verse from Kanye West is undoubtedly his best verse on the album. It sounds like something he would do on his 808s & Heartbreak album, and while he uses an odd vocal distortion for a line, the lyrics are great and his vocal delivery (with just the right amount of auto tune) is great as well. The second section comes after Kanye\u2019s verse and features the choir singing \u201cbeg forgiveness\u201d repeatedly until Ty Dolla $ign comes in on the second verse. His vocals are a bit scratchy and gravelly to start the verse, but after he warms up a bit, the harmonizing and vocal delivery are completely on point, and his lyrics, which describe him looking for forgiveness for his sins, are great. Awesome song with very inventive and creative production; just wish Chris Brown had sung in his normal voice.\u201cGOOD (DON\u2019T DIE) (feat. J.Rey SOUL)\u201d: Samples \u201cI Feel Love\u201d by Donna Summer in the form of J.Rey SOUL\u2019s vocals that imitate the chorus of \u201cI Feel Love,\u201d which is why it was taken down from steaming platforms (copyright infringement). The first verse from Kanye West was good, as he continued his revival of the sound he created on 808s & Heartbreak with this song, even sampling his \u201cStreet Lights\u201d from that album for the drum pattern on this song. The second verse from Ty Dolla $ign was okay, as his vocals mixed well with J.Rey SOUL\u2019s in some parts, but he completely bombed in other parts with bad lyrics and bad vocals. J.Rey SOUL was also a bit over the top in some parts; it would\u2019ve been beneficial for her to not hold some of the notes for as long as she did in her part. Overall, this song was one of the better tracks in this album, but it was still mid.\u201cKING\u201d: Wheezy, Dez Wright & JPEGMAFIA were absolutely cooking on that instrumental. The \u201caye\u201d ad-lib sampled from Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train\u201d was fire enough, but the drum pattern and soulful melody were amazingly epic. The production sounds sort of like Kanye West\u2019s early \u201cchop-up-the-soul\u201d days mixed with his grandiose, arena-sound My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy era, and it\u2019s a beautiful mix. Unfortunately, Kanye chooses this beat to have the chorus of the song be \u201cCrazy, bipolar, antisemite / And I\u2019m still the king.\u201d I\u2019ll give Kanye the benefit of the doubt and say he\u2019s not bragging about being a crazy, bipolar, antisemite, but he\u2019s merely reflecting what people are saying about him, but still, it\u2019s as if he embraces the titles on this chorus. He\u2019s almost saying \u201cYep, you got me,\u201d and following it up with \u201cBut I\u2019m still the king\u201d (in other words, he doesn\u2019t care). The chorus is absolutely awful, but the verses are partially good. When Kanye & Ty Dolla $ign are actually rapping on this song, the lyrics and flows are very good and match how great this beat is, but when they\u2019re doing weird stuff with their voices and pausing in the middle of the verse, it sucks. This song was never gonna be good because of how terrible the chorus is, but unfortunately, this beat was great and completely wasted with this song.The first album review of the new year 2024 (and it\u2019s coming at the end of February 2024, I know, but it\u2019s the first of many album reviews in 2024, so don\u2019t worry about that), and it\u2019s Kanye West\u2019s collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign that\u2019s reflective of how much he\u2019s changed since the botched release of Donda 2 on his Stem Player. Kanye West went through an entire devolution in 2022 that ultimately culminated in December of 2022 with his infamous InfoWars interview with Alex Jones where he culminated his anti-Semitism into comments such as \u201cThe Holocaust didn\u2019t happen\u201d and \u201cI believe every human being contributes something of value, especially Hitler.\u201d 2023 saw him shying away from the public eye and quietly marrying 29-year-old Yeezy creative director Bianca Censori and leaking the anti-Semitic single \u201cSomeday We\u2019ll All Be Free,\u201d much to the chagrin of everyone who listened to it. Vultures 1 was a long time coming, and I was convinced that it would never release, but on February 10, 2024, the 25th anniversary of Kanye West\u2019s debut album The College Dropout, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign dropped the album. I think it goes without saying that this album is Kanye West\u2019s worst project and Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s worst project, as Kanye West went all in and doubled down on his anti-Semitism, split from Kim Kardashian, new marriage to Bianca Censori, and various other controversial topics that he chose to bring up for some reason on this album, like R. Kelly and the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. Ty Dolla $ign unfortunately hitched himself to Kanye\u2019s wagon, which meant he was along for the ride as Kanye went on various rants deriding everyone he could think of in the Jewish community, from music industry executives to Drake, then trying to defend it by saying various things along the lines of \u201cKeep a few Jews on the staff now\u201d and \u201cHow I\u2019m Anti-Semitic? I just f***ed a Jewish b\u2014-.\u201d Ty Dolla $ign had a few egregious lines on this album as well, such as \u201cShe Russian, I beat that p\u2013 up for Ukraine,\u201d but none were quite as bad as what Kanye went for most of the time. The interesting thing about this album was that it sounded more like an electronic, EDM / house album than a hip-hop album, as Kanye West and his various producers, which included Timbaland, Wheezy, JPEGMAFIA, No I.D., AyoAA, Digital Nas, Wax Motif, and others (a laundry list of assembling the Avengers), dabbled in various club sounds, including (but not limited to) Jersey Club and Brazilian bass. The feature list on this album was extremely stacked, but for the most part, the featured artists couldn\u2019t do much to save these songs, or they performed just as badly as Kanye & Ty did. The worst feature on this album was undoubtedly Kanye\u2019s 10-year-old daughter North West, who rapped even worse than Drake\u2019s 5-year-old son Adonis over a Jersey Club beat for her feature. The best features included Playboi Carti & Chris Brown, who both gave exceptional contributions to \u201cFUK SUMN (feat. Playboi Carti & Travis Scott)\u201d & \u201cBEG FORGIVENESS (feat. Chris Brown),\u201d but even those performances had room for improvement. When Kanye dropped the politics and Ty was allowed to sing or rap melodically, this album hit its highs, but since those periods were few and far between, this album is in the graveyard of Kanye & Ty albums. Whether or not it\u2019s worse than For All The Dogs by Drake remains to be seen, though.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released December 10, 2023 (Re-Released December 17, 2023 & January 13, 2024)Genres: Pop Rap, Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Trap, DancehallTracks:Are You Gone Already (feat.

Billie Eilish)\u201d: Good Lord have mercy, I\u2019m immensely disappointed with this intro track. This song is a collab between Nicki Minaj & Billie Eilish, the Queen Of Rap and a top 5 all-time GOAT female vocalist, produced by FINNEAS, a former member of the top 10 all-time GOAT producer list (before he was replaced by Cirkut and then replaced by Chaz Jackson [not the guy I know from my business classes, but just as cool]), and sampling Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cwhen the party\u2019s over,\u201d which received a 9.4 in my review of Billie Eilish\u2019s WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an album I have no plans to re-review anytime soon. In other words, this song should\u2019ve been a slam-dunk certified hit, but it was a complete flop of horrendous proportions. The biggest problem I have with this song is the way Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cwhen the party\u2019s over\u201d is sampled on here. This track is produced by FINNEAS, the same guy who produced the original song, so it would stand to reason that he would know what to do with Billie\u2019s vocals, right? Wrong. The vocals from Billie Eilish on this song sound like Baby Billie Eilish, as they\u2019re heavily pitched up and sound like the voices of Baby Peach or Baby Daisy on Mario Kart. The sampled vocals are complete cringe and ruin the fact that this song is a collab between Nicki Minaj & Billie Eilish. The vocals, lyrics, and flows from Nicki Minaj on this song are absolutely awful as well. Nothing she\u2019s talking about makes any sense, and though I usually like Nicki\u2019s singing voice, it sounded warbly, poorly mixed, badly auto-tuned, and off-key on this track. The production from FINNEAS is absolutely awful as well; he punched his ticket to irrelevancy with the horrible sampling job and the terrible beat on here, which is minimalist production taken to a new extreme. The beat is a single 808 bass chord and a drum pattern with three drum hits in it. That\u2019s all it is. I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s no longer in my top 10 all-time GOAT producers list, and even if he does really well on Billie Eilish\u2019s next album, he won\u2019t be making it back on there. This song is atrocious.\u201cFTCU (feat. Waka Flocka Flame)\u201d: Horrendously bad. The production from ATL Jacob, much like the beat on the intro track from FINNEAS, was too minimalist and had long, awkward pauses between different parts of the beat, and when the beat was on, ATL Jacob did nothing more than make an extremely generic, bland, and cookie-cutter trap instrumental with a heavy 808 bassline. I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of ATL Jacob\u2019s production, and this song is just another example of why I\u2019m not a fan. The sampled chorus from Waka Flocka Flame, the same guy who made one of the greatest party songs of all time with \u201cNo Hands (feat. Roscoe Dash & Wale),\u201d is extremely lame and very uninspired, as it just sounds like the bargain-brand version of Sheck Wes\u2019 post-chorus and bridge on Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cNO BYSTANDERS (feat. Juice WRLD & Sheck Wes).\u201d It\u2019s also poorly sampled and badly mixed, as Waka Flocka Flame\u2019s delivery sounds choppy and grainy at times. The two verses from Nicki Minaj are just atrociously bad in terms of lyrics, vocals, and flow \u2013 that\u2019s really all there is to say about them. Terrible song.\u201cLet Me Calm Down (feat. J. Cole)\u201d: After a very disappointing start that included botched collabs with Billie Eilish & Waka Flocka Flame and a few mid beats from ATL Jacob, Nicki Minaj is finally showing why she called this album Pink Friday 2, as this track\u2019s greatness is reminiscent of her stuff from the first Pink Friday album. The production from ATL Jacob & Hendrix Smoke is great, as the fast-paced, melodic drum pattern mixes well with the amazing vocal sample, which sounds very similar to the vocal sample from Drake\u2019s \u201cDo Not Disturb,\u201d where the song \u201cTime\u201d by Snoh Aalegra is sampled. Nicki Minaj is firing on all cylinders on this track; her singing on the intro and chorus is beautiful, and her first verse has great lyrics, a great flow, and poignant subject matter about standing by your significant other even when times are tough. Nicki shows off her versatility as a singer and rapper brilliantly with this song; it\u2019s her best performance on the album so far. J. Cole, who has had ups and downs in 2023 with features, had an awesome verse on this song. His lyrics were great, his flow was on-point, and his subject matter, which was similar to Nicki Minaj\u2019s but told a story about a relationship where both people faced various obstacles but eventually overcame them with their love, was epic as well. This song is the first ever collab between Nicki Minaj & J. Cole, and J. Cole definitely showed up in a big way on this track with his verse. He was a highlight on Drake\u2019s very bad For All The Dogs album with his feature verse on \u201cFirst Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole),\u201d but his feature on Drake\u2019s \u201cEvil Ways (feat. J. Cole)\u201d was extremely mid, so hopefully this banger of a verse ends the inconsistency and puts Cole on a hot streak. Great song; much needed to put this album on the right track.\u201cRNB (feat. Lil Wayne & Tate Kobang)\u201d: Great production from Tate Kobang & YG! Beats; the light, heavily reverbed, and bell-like synth melody sounds like an 80\u2019s synthpop song, but the smooth drum & 808 patterns make the song sound like a smooth R&B track. It\u2019s a great combination that makes for an awesome beat. The chorus from Tate Kobang; a rapper, singer, and producer who has worked with Nicki Minaj frequently as a producer but hasn\u2019t usually given vocals to her tracks; was average at best, as his vocals are good and the harmonies are good, but the lyrics are mid and his flow was average at best. The first verse from Nicki Minaj is the best one on the song, but it\u2019s good at best. Her flow was solid and most of the lyrics were alright (there were some vulgar lines, but I didn\u2019t mind them because I\u2019ve come to expect that from Nicki Minaj and they were a lot less vulgar than what I usually hear from her), but her vocal delivery was unenthusiastic and the subject matter wasn\u2019t good either. The second verse from Lil Wayne was bad, as it was extremely repetitive, the lyrics were all a variation of his famous line \u201cPop that p**** for a real playa,\u201d his flow was mid, and the subject matter was just him feining (i.e. craving sex) the entire time. Unfortunately, Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne continue their streak of inconsistency with this collab, as Nicki & Weezy have historically been very hit and miss when on tracks together despite being usually awesome individually.\u201cPink Birthday\u201d: This track samples \u201cPornography (feat. T.I.)\u201d by Travis Scott! Although the sample is an extreme W and Boi-1da does a great job implementing the sample, which uses some of Travis Scott\u2019s harmonies and the melody from the original track, into this song, Nicki Minaj takes a much more literal approach to the title of \u201cpornography\u201d than Travis Scott ever did with the original song. The chorus is Nicki\u2019s best contribution to the song, as her singing is sultry, smooth, and ethereal, but the verse absolutely sucks. The lyrics are vulgar, weird, and dumb, and the flow and vocals are also bad. Although the Travis Scott sample is an extreme W, the song is an overall L because of Nicki\u2019s horrible performance.\u201cNeedle (feat. Drake)\u201d: I\u2019m not a fan of either of these artists doing dancehall, but this song is far from the worst dancehall track I\u2019ve heard from Drake or Nicki Minaj. The first verse from Drake is good, as his flow over the dancehall drum pattern is smooth, easygoing, and comfortable, his lyrics are good, and his vocal delivery is good as well. This verse is better than the majority of performances he gave on his last album For All The Dogs, and while that\u2019s a low bar to set, Drake doing dancehall well is reminiscent of his albums Views and More Life, where he had several great tracks with verses similar to this one. However, Drake\u2019s chorus is terrible. He adopts a Jamaican accent on the chorus, his lyrics are terrible (the line \u201cMy lil\u2019 wild eye / Been a shy guy all of my life\u201d has to be the cringiest line on there), and the chorus completely contrasts the smooth and easygoing flow he had on the previous verse. The second verse from Nicki Minaj is very good, as her lyrics, flow, and vocals are all good, but Drake comes in with his bad chorus, then Nicki Minaj adopts a Jamaican accent for part of the bridge, and while the bridge is mostly salvaged by Nicki & Nina Fofie harmonizing and singing very well, the Jamaican accent is just ridiculously cringe. The production from Boi-1da & 40 on this song is very good, as the dancehall drums are perfectly executed and the smooth melody is a perfect complement to them, but Drake & Nicki\u2019s horrendously awful Jamaican accents and bad lyrics going along with it completely ruin the song.\u201cEverybody (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)\u201d: The second good song so far on this album and a track I\u2019d heard many times before reviewing this album. This song is a certified party banger: A Jersey Club track that samples Junior Senior\u2019s upbeat early 2000\u2019s club anthem \u201cMove Your Feet\u201d and features Lil Uzi Vert, who is responsible for launching the Jersey Club phenomenon with his own party banger \u201cJust Wanna Rock.\u201d For those who are unaware, Jersey Club is a genre defined by its highly danceable drum pattern of \u201cboom, boom, boom-boom-boom,\u201d which is usually accomplished by bass drums or short, chopped 808s. This song utilizes that drum pattern extremely well, and the chopped-up nature of the Junior Senior \u201cMove Your Feet\u201d sample goes perfectly with it. On both of Nicki Minaj\u2019s verses, she uses the sampled lyric \u201c-body\u201d to finish off each line she gives, and it\u2019s very cool. Probably my favorite use of this sampled lyric is when Nicki says \u201c\u2018Nother year, \u2018nother Vince Lom\u2019 (-body)\u201d at the end of her first verse, referencing her wins using the Vince Lombardi Super Bowl trophy in a creative way. The chorus from Nicki Minaj is great, as instead of using the sampled lyric \u201c-body,\u201d she uses the full word \u201ceverybody\u201d to finish her lines (i.e. \u201cWe gon\u2019 spin and kill (everybody)\u201d). The first two verses from Nicki Minaj are both very good, but her flow can get a bit choppy and rushed at times since she\u2019s trying to rap around the sampled lyrics that come in at the end of each measure. She does a great job for the most part, but some lines she struggles to make work. The bridges are where Nicki really struggles on this song, as she gives bad and unnecessary ad-libs over the sampled lyrics \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop the beat,\u201d which are repeated and sped up from the original song. The two verses from Lil Uzi Vert on this song are both average at best, as the verses could\u2019ve been much better and they really struggle to find their footing on the third verse, where they can\u2019t stay on the beat and only use the \u201c-body\u201d vocals well a couple of times. Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s best contribution to the song was undoubtedly their ad-libs over the chorus, saying \u201cThis ain\u2019t what you want\u201d like they did on \u201cJust Wanna Rock\u201d while Nicki gave the chorus. Good song, but I wish Lil Uzi Vert had put a bit more energy into those verses and hadn\u2019t been tripped up by the unconventional but fire beat.\u201cRed Ruby Da Sleeze\u201d: I wasn\u2019t expecting anything from this song since none of Nicki Minaj\u2019s solo songs have been good so far on this album and the other singles \u201cSuper Freaky Girl\u201d & \u201cBig Difference\u201d were both bad (I heard them before this album came out), but wow, this song was very good. The production from Go Grizzly, Cheeze Beats, and Tate Kobang was great, as the sample of one-hit wonder Lumidee\u2019s \u201cNever Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh),\u201d which was an early 2000\u2019s pop song was brilliantly executed, and the sampled vocals went great with the drum pattern that mixed elements of trap and dancehall. The 808 pattern was also amazingly well done. Both of Nicki Minaj\u2019s verses were very good, and the chorus, despite Nicki Minaj doing a Jamaican accent for part of it, was great. The bridge, on the other hand, was the lowlight of the song, being average at best with a bad flow, mid lyrics, and an overdone Jamaican accent from Nicki Minaj, but that chorus was great. Nicki showed off her great singing voice and delivered a chorus that sounded more like Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWork (feat. Drake)\u201d than Nicki\u2019s Jamaican accent on her own Drake collab from this album. There were a few bad lines and weird vocals in both of Nicki\u2019s verses, but they were overall very good. I\u2019ve gotta say, I didn\u2019t expect one of Nicki\u2019s solo songs to be one of the best tracks on the album, but she really brought it on this song.\u201cPink Friday Girls (feat. Cyndi Lauper & Lourdiz)\u201d: I really wanted to like this song. There are a lot of things about it that I love. Firstly, the song samples \u201cGirls Just Wanna Have Fun\u201d by Cyndi Lauper, which is one of Nicki Minaj\u2019s favorite songs and a classic 80\u2019s pop banger, and the sample is very well done, as Cyndi Lauper\u2019s sampled vocals on the chorus are great and the melody from the original song is blended very well with trap drums & 808s. Secondly, Nicki Minaj singing the chorus alongside Cyndi Lauper is absolutely awesome. \u201cThe phone rings, in the middle of the night / My father yells \u2018What you gonna do with your life?\u2019\u201d delivered by Nicki Minaj & Cyndi Lauper is so fire, and the sample taking it from there makes it that much better. Thirdly, Lourdiz singing the bridge at the end of the track, which has the same lyrics as the bridge from the original song, is amazing. Her vocals are awesome, and she totally redeems herself from the horrendous performance she gave on \u201cCowgirl (feat. Lourdiz).\u201d All three of those things were epic, but Nicki Minaj\u2019s verses were not. They were mid at best, as Nicki sounded like she was trying too hard to recreate \u201cSuper Bass,\u201d even dropping the title of that song in the second verse, which made the attempt even more obvious. The flows and lyrics on the verses were like a downgraded version of \u201cSuper Bass,\u201d which made it hard not to compare this track to \u201cSuper Bass,\u201d which was far better and had a far more organic sound. The Cyndi Lauper stuff on here was awesome, but Nicki blatantly trying to rip off her own song makes this track mid.\u201cNicki Hendrix (feat. Future)\u201d: Obviously, the title of this song is referring to Nicki\u2019s collaboration with Future Hendrix instead of Jimi Hendrix, but honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if this song sampled Jimi Hendrix while featuring Future. A collab between Future & Jimi Hendrix would be absolutely awesome, but I digress. The vocals from Future on this song are whiny, pitchy, and in a much higher register than he usually raps or sings in. Future\u2019s verse, chorus, and bridge on this song are all done in this weird, whiny, high-pitched vocal cadence, and it does absolutely nothing for him. I understand that he\u2019s trying to be emotional and show a softer, more vulnerable side of himself like he did for some of the tracks on his R&B-infused album HNDRXX, but this song sucks and it\u2019s mostly because of Future. Those vocals were terrible, and his lyrics were repetitive and flavorless. The verses from Nicki Minaj were mid at best, as she tries to match Future\u2019s high-pitched vocal cadence and does far better than he does in this register, but still, it doesn\u2019t sound great, and amidst a few vulnerable lines and emotionally charged lyrics, Nicki throws in \u201cThis p**** taste like water,\u201d and it completely ruins the effect. Not a good song.\u201cBlessings (feat. Beau Nox & Tasha Cobbs Leonard)\u201d: BNYX\u00ae & SADPONY producing a gospel song featuring EDM / house producer Beau Nox & gospel singer Tasha Cobbs Leonard?! That\u2019s certainly something I wasn\u2019t expecting. The architect behind modern electro-rage rap music and Yeat\u2019s signature sound (i.e. BNYX\u00ae) combined with the architect behind Lil Yachty\u2019s psychedelic experience Let\u2019s Start Here. (i.e. SADPONY) collaborating with Nicki Minaj to make a gospel song with the architect behind Drake\u2019s Honestly, Nevermind (i.e. Beau Nox) and a gospel singer more likely to be on a Lecrae album than a Nicki Minaj album (i.e. Tasha Cobbs Leonard). It\u2019s an odd combination of artists, but it works pretty well, I\u2019ve gotta say. The stars of this song are Tasha Cobbs Leonard, who absolutely kills it on her third verse, where she gives an impassioned verse about her faith, and BNYX\u00ae & SADPONY, whose production hits the perfect sweet spot between gospel, trap, and EDM. Nicki Minaj\u2019s verses are all good, but they don\u2019t have the same level of emotion or impact as the Tasha Cobbs Leonard feature verse. Good song that could easily serve as an outro.\u201cJust The Memories\u201d: A reflective, poignant, victory lap track from Nicki Minaj with three rapped verses and a sung chorus. The first two verses were both good at best, as the lyrics were good and Nicki Minaj reflecting on her past and what it took to get her to the position she is in now is very cool to hear, but the flows and vocal delivery on those verses were not good. The chorus is good because it shows off Nicki\u2019s vocal talent and how good of a singer she is, but the lyrics could\u2019ve been better. The third verse is very good; it\u2019s definitely the best one from Nicki on the track, as she\u2019s reflecting on her recent history and her relationships with Drake & Lil Wayne, as well as her relationship with her husband and her child. On the first two verses, Nicki seems detached from the subject matter, as if she\u2019s rapping about something that she can barely recall and is such a distant memory to her that it\u2019s somewhat faded, but on this third one, she sounds more hopeful and more impassioned about what she\u2019s talking about. I know I said that \u201cBlessings (feat. Beau Nox & Tasha Cobbs Leonard)\u201d would\u2019ve worked very well as an outro, but I think this song is a pretty good outro as well. Good song.\u201cPress Play (feat. Future)\u201d: Okay, I might have to take back some of the stuff I said about ATL Jacob because this beat was fire. The piano arpeggio melody mixed with the fast-paced trap drums and booming 808 bass was an incredible combination, and ATL Jacob absolutely killed it with production on this track. After \u201cNicki Hendrix (feat. Future),\u201d I can see why Future wanted another collab with Nicki on this album, and he definitely delivered on it. The only part that wasn\u2019t good was his constant repetition of \u201cPress play, lil booty b****, press play, big booty b\u2014-,\u201d which went on for most of the song. That took a few points off the song, but Future\u2019s verse and most of his chorus were both great. Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse on this track was trash, though. In addition to a subtle diss against Beyonc\u00e9, Nicki brought out some bad vocal delivery and a trash flow over the best ATL Jacob beat on this album. Future definitely redeemed himself after the bad performance on the previous feature, but unfortunately, Nicki couldn\u2019t be bothered to show up on this song, even with a great beat from ATL Jacob.The last album review of 2023 (being completed on February 18, 2024) (I\u2019m very behind on reviews right now, but I\u2019ll be caught up soon), and it\u2019s the sequel to Nicki Minaj\u2019s breakout 2010 debut album Pink Friday, which is her best album according to where it currently ranks on the review page and my personal opinion of it. That album had everything going for it, though, so there was no reason for it not to be successful. It was a pop rap album at a time when pop and hip-hop were both amazingly good and artists from those genres frequently crossed over to make massive hit songs. The album featured Eminem, fresh off the release of his 2010 album Recovery (a hit-and-miss album, but definitely one of his more pop rap albums and one of his better albums as well, as he fused his style somewhat successfully with pop on it), Rihanna, whose dominance in pop music cannot be overstated, Drake, fresh off the release of his 2010 debut album Thank Me Later (another album that extremely successfully blended pop and hip-hop and started his dominance of pop rap), will.i.am, fresh off the release of the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 2010 album The Beginning (a pop rap classic that brilliantly fused pop, hip-hop, and EDM), Kanye West, whose album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy released on the same day (and is an absolute staple in pop rap, as he successfully blended pop, hip-hop, rock, EDM, and other genres for that album), and Natasha Bedingfield, whose songs \u201cPocketful Of Sunshine\u201d & \u201cUnwritten\u201d are pop classics. In short, Pink Friday was never not going to be successful, but Nicki Minaj made a name for herself by making a great pop rap album with those artists and on her own with songs like \u201cSuper Bass,\u201d \u201cRight Thru Me,\u201d and \u201cSave Me.\u201d Unfortunately, this album doesn\u2019t even come close to being as good as Pink Friday, not even by a longshot. It\u2019s not that Nicki Minaj has gotten worse since 2010, as her talent as a singer and a rapper is still as apparent on this album as it was on Pink Friday, but she\u2019s gotten more vulgar, far less consistent, lazier with lyricism and collaborations, and worse production. The samples, especially those from 80\u2019s pop, are a consistency between both Pink Friday albums, as the first one featured samples from \u201c(Don\u2019t You) Forget About Me\u201d by Simple Minds (on \u201cBlazin (feat. Kanye West)\u201d) and \u201cVideo Killed The Radio Star\u201d by The Buggles (on \u201cCheck It Out (with will.i.am)\u201d), and this one included samples from \u201cGirls Just Wanna Have Fun\u201d by Cyndi Lauper (on \u201cPink Friday Girls (feat. Cyndi Lauper & Lourdiz)\u201d) and \u201cHeart Of Glass\u201d by Blondie (on \u201cMy Life\u201d), among others, but on the first album, no samples were misused. On this one, there were some egregiously misused samples. The main ones that come to mind are \u201cwhen the party\u2019s over\u201d by Billie Eilish (on the intro track \u201cAre You Gone Already (feat. Billie Eilish)\u201d), \u201cPornography (feat. T.I.)\u201d by Travis Scott (on \u201cPink Birthday\u201d), and \u201cSuper Freak\u201d by Rick James (on \u201cSuper Freaky Girl\u201d). However, one sample where Nicki knocked it out of the park was \u201cMove Your Feet\u201d by Junior Senior, which was turned into a Jersey Club banger on \u201cEverybody (feat. Lil Uzi Vert).\u201d On \u201cLet Me Calm Down (feat. J. Cole),\u201d the only 10 on the album, Nicki Minaj showed flashes of brilliance that signaled to me this album was meant to be 2010\u2019s Pink Friday\u2019s sequel, but on the other songs, especially the collabs with Drake & Lil Wayne, both of whom were featured on Pink Friday, I didn\u2019t get that impression at all. Overall, this album sampled a lot of great songs and Nicki got to show off her skills as a singer and rapper on multiple separate occasions, but this album sounded unfocused, inconsistent, and unworthy of being a sequel to Nicki\u2019s debut album Pink Friday.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 5, 2023Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Trap, Dirty SouthTracks:Rob49, Ray-Ray McCloud III, Melvin Ingram \u2013 Primetime (feat.

Lebra Jolie) \u2013 7Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cPrimetime (feat. Jay Rock & J300)\u201d by Rob49, Ray-Ray McCloud III & Melvin Ingram: I hate to give this song a mid score. This song (and this album as a whole, as I\u2019ve listened to all of the songs on this album at least once before this review) combines tons of things I love: Hip-hop music, motivational lyrics, NFL football (in every way, shape, and form: there are NFL players rapping on this song, there are lyrics about football, and there are metaphors comparing football to life), and Madden (this album is featured in full on Madden NFL 24). However, if this song didn\u2019t combine so many of these things I love, it would\u2019ve probably gotten a worse score. The production on this song from Turbo and Kansas City Chiefs TE Noah Gray (a very random combination of producers here) is good, as the triumphant trumpet melody, heavy 808 bass, and fast-paced, clap-heavy trap drums make this beat perfect for any motivational, hype, gym banger track. However, the verses and chorus on this song leave a lot to be desired. The song starts with J300 (who I\u2019d not heard of before this song and still can\u2019t find any info on), who raps with the trumpet melody and no drums in a high-pitched, heavily auto-tuned, whiny, nasally, and offbeat flow. He has some good lines on this verse, as his metaphors comparing football to life (which I love to do in any and all situations) hit hard, but nothing else about this verse hits at all. After this bad verse, Rob49, Mr. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to hide, I\u2019m a dawg, man, I make a mistake and show it\u201d from Travis Scott\u2019s banger \u201cTOPIA TWINS (feat. Rob49 & 21 Savage),\u201d has a verse that\u2019s average. There are a few good lines in this verse, but he doesn\u2019t go nearly as hard as he did on the Travis Scott collab he had, and his good lines mostly revolve around football references. San Francisco 49ers WR Ray-Ray McCloud III does the chorus, which is mid at best, as his singing is poorly auto-tuned, his flow is offbeat, and his lyrics are surface-level at best. Jay Rock handles the next verse, which is average. It has a few cringe lines in it that ruin the overall verse, and while he drops a few football references and shouts out his record label TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment) on the verse, it\u2019s not one of his stronger features. Ray-Ray McCloud III returns with another mid at best chorus, then the star of the track shows up. Miami Dolphins MLB Melvin Ingram, who doesn\u2019t even start on the team despite being a first-round draft pick in 2012 by the LA Chargers, shows up big time with a good verse where he discusses his personal struggles and NFL career while rapping in a very solid auto-tuned flow where he only gets offbeat once or twice. This song is mid, but mainly because it has so many contributions from people of varying skill levels.\u201cHim\u201d by Terron Armstead, That Mexican OT & Derrick Milano: The production on this song is pretty bad. This beat, produced by Derrick Milano, Nellz, Dejuan Cross & Deafh Beatz (three no-namers and one guy who\u2019s on the song), is not good, as the synth melody doubles as the 808 pattern with grainy, electronic, robotic, and unsettling notes played quickly and repeatedly. However, even though the production is extremely subpar, the song is still good. The motivational lyrics, football references, and great verses by Miami Dolphins OT Terron Armstead and Derrick Milano (a rapper best known for dating porn star, model, and socialite Blac Chyna, who also dated Tyga & Rob Kardashian) were what pushed this song past its bad production. The chorus from That Mexican OT (which, for clarity, means \u201cThat Mexican Outta Texas\u201d and not \u201cThat Mexican Offensive Tackle\u201d) isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s motivational in nature, and the line: \u201cThey keep askin\u2019 \u2018who the hell you think you are?\u2019 / Him, him, him, him, I\u2019m him\u201d is absolutely awesome. I knew this album was gonna have some great motivational lines in it, but even the simple proclamation of \u201cI\u2019m him\u201d is enough to get me hyped. Terron Armstead\u2019s verse is great, and Derrick Milano\u2019s verse is great as well (he had a banger line with \u201cI did the impossible, but I\u2019m not Kim\u201d). Bad beat, but good lyrics, flows, and verses.\u201cCold Now\u201d by Terron Armstead, Ray-Ray McCloud III & Melvin Ingram: \u201cAlright, I got \u2018em\u201d Terron Armstead confidently asserts before launching into the first verse on this fast-paced, gritty, dense 808 & heavy snare drum trap beat produced by EST Gee. Before this song, I didn\u2019t know EST Gee was a rapper and a producer, but clearly he understands his sound because this song sounds like something that would be on an EST Gee album. Terron Armstead may not be the most well-known NFL player on this album, but he\u2019s putting up an MVP level performance on here. As soon as I heard him say \u201cAlright, I got \u2018em,\u201d I knew this verse was gonna be fire, and he did not disappoint. He dropped banger lines like \u201cWe ain\u2019t playin\u2019 / HBCU, I strike up the band\u201d & \u201cIn Miami, Hard Rock jumpin\u2019 like a rock band / You know me, I\u2019m \u2018bout my green and cheese like a Packers fan\u201d while rapping in a confident and powerful flow. The second verse from Ray-Ray McCloud III was definitely the weakest part of the song, as his flow was choppy, his lyrics had no direction, and before he was able to get going, Melvin Ingram cut him off by starting his third verse, which was already considerably better than Ray-Ray McCloud III\u2019s mid performance in its opening lines. Melvin Ingram\u2019s use of auto-tune throughout this album has really lent itself to some good verses and great flows from him, and this verse continued that trend. There were a few lines where Melvin Ingram could\u2019ve had better lyrics or better delivery, but the verse was very good overall. \u201cI gotta stop rockin\u2019 so many chains, I was tryna work out, and it hurt my stomach\u201d is probably my favorite line from his verse. Terron Armstead & Melvin Ingram had great performances on this track, and EST Gee\u2019s production was very good as well, but Ray-Ray McCloud III was not needed at all on this track.\u201cStep\u201d by Ray-Ray McCloud III, Terron Armstead & Darren Waller: This song has the best production that I\u2019ve heard so far on this album. The production from New York Giants TE Darren Waller (who is also on the song) & Derrick Milano (Blac Chyna\u2019s boyfriend who is on another song on this album) incorporates a triumphant yet gritty trumpet melody that\u2019s choppy and powerful, making it perfect for any hype gym banger song. The trap drum pattern is awesome as well, and it provides a perfect complement to the melody. Even though some of the other songs on this album have been produced by career producers, this beat is my favorite that I\u2019ve heard so far. The chorus from Ray-Ray McCloud III is average, but it gets the job done well enough in that it acts as a tie-in for the verses and isn\u2019t too long. The first verse from Terron Armstead is absolutely awesome. He goes insanely hard on that verse; his flow is great, his lyrics are great, and his delivery perfectly matches the hype tone of the instrumental. Whenever he retires from the NFL, he could have a real career ahead of him as a rapper. I would for sure listen to his music; if it\u2019s anything like the MVP level performances he\u2019s giving on this album, it\u2019ll be fire. Ray-Ray McCloud III, on the other hand, needs to stick to playing football (mainly returning punts and kickoffs) because he had another verse that was the weakest link of the song. The verse on here was average at best, but it still wasn\u2019t good, and his attempt to harmonize in auto-tune was completely cringe. The third verse from New York Giants TE Darren Waller was great, but it was way too short. As soon as I started jamming to his verse, it was over and I had to listen to Ray-Ray McCloud III\u2019s chorus, which was a serious downgrade from Darren Waller\u2019s verse. If he had gone in for as long as Terron Armstead had, Darren Waller might\u2019ve outdone Terron Armstead. Either way, this song is great, but Ray-Ray McCloud III needs to stop being featured on this album.\u201cSweep\u201d by Darren Waller, Terron Armstead, Melvin Ingram & DJ Chark Jr.: Another great, triumphant, trumpet melody instrumental with a solid trap drum pattern from Derrick Milano. This one is much more upbeat and lends itself not only to hype and being a gym banger, but also being motivational, which is perfect for this song. Darren Waller starts the song with a very good chorus, where he confidently asserts \u201cIt\u2019s a sweep,\u201d which could be referencing the sweep play in football, which is a run play to the outside the offensive tackles, or it could be referencing a decisive victory or multi-game dominance (reinforced by Terron Armstead saying \u201cIt\u2019s a sweep, right? / Shout-out to Jokic,\u201d referencing the Denver Nuggets victory in the 2023 NBA Finals). Either way, it\u2019s a fire chorus, but I could\u2019ve done without the \u201cGet that boy outta there\u201d ad-libs, as they were kinda annoying and unnecessary. The first verse from Darren Waller is motivational, hype, and extremely energetic. Lyrics and flow were both on point as well. Darren Waller finally got a full verse, and he made the absolute most of it. Terron Armstead did the second verse and continued his streak of having only great verses with another fire verse. Melvin Ingram did the third verse, and this verse was undoubtedly his best one on the album despite the fact that his other verses were great as well. His lyrics and flow were both great, but the line that really stood out to me because it was epic was the motivational \u201cWhat separate good and great, it\u2019s they mental.\u201d Everything about this song (except for the ad-libs on the chorus) was perfect until Carolina Panthers WR DJ Chark Jr. stepped in for the fourth verse and completely stunk it up. He\u2019s terrible at football and at rapping, apparently, and he fumbled the bag on this verse like he fumbled a touchdown in Week 18 against the Buccaneers in the 2023 season. For the sake of my team, I hope he\u2019s not resigned, and for the sake of this album, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s not on here again. Great song, but DJ Chark Jr. really prevented it from being as good as it could\u2019ve been.\u201cNo Problems (feat. Lebra Jolie)\u201d by Rob49, Melvin Ingram, Darren Waller, Terron Armstead & Derrick Milano: Production from Derrick Milano, Aye YB, and T Will (two no-namers and one guy who\u2019s on the song [albeit the last two beats from Derrick Milano on this album have been good]) on this song has a triumphant sounding trumpet melody, but it ultimately sounds hollow and fails to generate hype or a motivational sound. The 808 pattern is too heavy and aggressive, and the trap drum pattern is stale and not well-executed. The chorus from Derrick Milano (and Rob49 shouting the ad-libs, which is annoying and bad) is mid and pretty much carried by the motivational line \u201cAll I know is win, I ain\u2019t ever took an L,\u201d since it\u2019s repetitive and boring other than that line. The first verse from Rob49 has some cool football references in it, as he shouts out Cincinnati Bengals WR Ja\u2019Marr Chase and describes going for it on 4th down with a run play, but the verse is ultimately average at best and not one of his better performances, as his flow is too aggressive, choppy, and hard to understand at times, and the lyrics are not good with the exception of the football references. The second verse from Lebra Jolie, who is essentially the bargain-brand version of Cardi B with flow and vocal cadence, references a bunch of football players like Tom Brady & Patrick Mahomes (and references scoring a touchdown and hitting the Griddy like Rob49\u2019s verse did), but her lyrics are pretty cringe and the fact that she sounds almost exactly like Cardi B is very off-putting and ruins the sound of this song. Melvin Ingram handles the third verse and gives his worst performance on the album with a mid verse. His verse had no memorable lines, a lukewarm and stale flow, and mid lyrics that didn\u2019t say anything he hadn\u2019t said before. The fourth verse from Darren Waller and the fifth verse from Terron Armstead were the best on the song, and I hated that they took a backseat to the mid performances from everyone else on this track. These verses were great and served to bump this track up from bad to low mid, but they were too short and these guys didn\u2019t have enough space to do any consequential song-saving. It\u2019s interesting to me that the NFL players have been better on this album for the most part than the career rappers. It was definitely the case on this song, which is an underwhelming outro for an album that\u2019s been pretty good.This album is a combination of some of my all-time favorite things: NFL football, music (specifically hip-hop music), motivational lyrics, hype songs, Madden, and hearing music from people who aren\u2019t known for making music. I mean, this album is a group of NFL players, rappers, and hip-hop producers getting together to make an album for my favorite video game of all time! It would not be far-fetched to say that this album is right up my alley. Although every song on this album isn\u2019t a hit, most of them are really good and will be going in my hype playlist, gym banger playlist, and Best Of Madden Soundtracks playlist. The main draw of this album for me is the NFL players rapping. In terms of getting motivated and getting hyped up, there\u2019s no one better to listen to than an NFL player (besides maybe an NFL coach, but I don\u2019t see Bill Belichick or Andy Reid making a rap album anytime soon). I mean, these are guys who have gotten the bag by making it in one of the toughest leagues in the world (as there are only 1696 spots available in the NFL, with 32 teams each having 53 men on their rosters) (the only tougher league would be the NBA, where there are feasibly 450 spots available in a 30-team league with 15-man rosters), have to keep themselves in peak physical and mental condition day in and day out, have to be intrinsically motivated to be their absolute best or risk losing their job to someone who is, and who have come from various backgrounds, some more troubled than most modern-day rappers, who are liable to capping in their music about what they\u2019ve done or where they\u2019re from. Listening to NFL players rap about the game, their money, their struggles, and how life is like football sounds right: it sounds genuine. These are guys that even the most famous rappers look up to; they\u2019re a different kind of famous, as it\u2019s much harder to make it in the NFL than it is to make it in the music industry. I was extremely impressed with the performances from OT Terron Armstead & MLB Melvin Ingram of the Miami Dolphins, as well as those of New York Giants TE Darren Waller. Melvin Ingram had a single mid verse on the final song from this album, but other than that, these three guys carried this album. They rapped circles around career rappers Rob49 & Jay Rock, whose verses paled in comparison to these guys, who have careers ahead of them in the rap game if they want it after they retire from the NFL. However, the wide receivers didn\u2019t show up on this album, as San Francisco 49ers WR and return man Ray-Ray McCloud III and Carolina Panthers WR DJ Chark Jr. both sucked on this album. Ray-Ray McCloud III had three songs on this album, and on each one, he was terrible. However, DJ Chark Jr. probably had the second worst verse on the album with his awful verse, only above bargain-brand Cardi B Lebra Jolie, who had no business being on this album. Banger lines were dropped in abundance on this album, though, as the NFL players showed up big time when it came to motivational lyrics, lyrics about football, and lyrics comparing the dedication and drive required to play football to life. The production on this album was hit and miss, as the majority of the beats included triumphant-sounding trumpet melodies, hard trap drums, and loud 808 basslines, which worked better on some songs than others. I would say it depended on the producer, but seasoned Gunna, Lil Baby, and Young Thug producer Turbo made a mid beat to start the album, and Derrick Milano went 2 for 4 on this album with beats. I\u2019ve gotta say, the most impressive part of this album was the fact that the NFL players outperformed the rappers. If Darren Waller, Terron Armstead, and Melvin Ingram release albums, I will be listening to them.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released December 8, 2023Genres: Pop, Emo, Elegant PopTracks:cut my hair \u2013 9.4greedy \u2013 10run for the hills \u2013 9.4hurt my feelings \u2013 10grave \u2013 7.4stay done \u2013 7.2exes \u2013 10we\u2019re not alike \u2013 8calgary \u2013 7.7messier \u2013 5.6think later \u2013 7.2guilty conscience \u2013 8.4want that too \u2013 7.4plastic palm trees \u2013 4.6Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201ccut my hair\u201d: Wow. I\u2019m absolutely blown away by this amazing intro track. I\u2019ve listened to Tate McRae ever since she burst onto the scene in early 2020 with her debut album all the things i never said, and I can confidently say this song is one of the best tracks I\u2019ve heard from her. I\u2019ve always thought Tate McRae was a good singer, as her vocals are very similar to two of my favorite pop singers and top 5 female vocalists Sabrina Carpenter & Billie Eilish, but this song has some of the best vocals she\u2019s ever done. The harmonizing on the outro, the vocal range displayed between the chorus (higher octaves) and verses (lower octaves), and the evocative delivery of certain lines: They all show that Tate McRae is taking it to the next level and is ready to move from pop star with flat vocals focusing in the emo pop genre to pop superstar with vocal ranges rivaling top 5 female vocalists. The lyrics on this song are great; they\u2019re not emo like all of the songs on Tate McRae\u2019s previous album i used to think i could fly, and Tate sings about \u201ccut[ting] [her] hair\u201d and \u201clos[ing] [her]self\u201d on the chorus, which not only display the subject matter of not being over an ex-boyfriend, but also show that she\u2019s evolved beyond the cookie-cutter emo pop mold and is trying to become a genuine pop superstar with this album. Probably the biggest takeaway from this song lyrically is the line: \u201cSad girl bit got a little boring.\u201d Excellent! It\u2019s what I always wanted from Tate McRae, and now she\u2019s finally doing it, hopefully. The production on this song is also great, as it sounds very similar to Migos\u2019 \u201cTop Down On Da NAWF,\u201d the lo-fi banger from Culture II, but it doesn\u2019t sample it. I\u2019m really impressed and looking forward to the rest of the album now.\u201cgreedy\u201d: Tate McRae with the Timbaland drums! It\u2019s a hit for sure! This song samples Nelly Furtado\u2019s party classic \u201cPromiscuous (feat. Timbaland)\u201d for another song that\u2019s sure to become a party banger in no time. The production on this song is awesome, needless to say, as Ryan Tedder\u2019s electropop melody blends perfectly with Timbaland\u2019s epic drums. There\u2019s a reason why Timbaland is the GOAT, and his sampling on this song only further proves that status. This song is another one where Tate McRae establishes herself as a pop superstar. No emo lyrics in sight on this track \u2013 she\u2019s confident, boastful, braggadocious, and declares that \u201cshe would want herself\u201d while having a dialogue between her and a male character on the chorus and verses, respectively. Great vocal performance, great lyrics, great subject matter, and great production. Overall, this song is most likely my favorite song Tate McRae has ever done and it\u2019s a certified 10 pop banger.\u201crun for the hills\u201d: Tate McRae is really working hard to upgrade her development trait from pop star to pop superstar on this album (a little Madden reference) because this track is another great pop banger. This track\u2019s sultry, smooth, and seductive production with deep synths and sporadic drums leans into the elegant pop genre cultivated by pop superstar x-factors Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, and even Billie Eilish on her most recent album Happier Than Ever. Ryan Tedder does a great job with this production, and it allows Tate McRae to be in her element sounding seductive, sultry, and elegantly sexy while talking about getting into a relationship when she knows she shouldn\u2019t. The vocals are great on this track, and while there are a few moments in the verses where Tate\u2019s lyrics and flows could\u2019ve been better, this song is overall another massive W for her.\u201churt my feelings\u201d: This album already has more good songs than any of Tate McRae\u2019s other albums, and with the way it\u2019s going right now, I\u2019d say this album is looking to have more good songs than any other Tate McRae album combined. From i used to think i could fly to this album is like night and day. This song sounds like what would happen if Sabrina Carpenter, Jeremih, and DJ Mustard did a collab together. The production on this song sounds like sultry Mustard club banger (without the \u201chey\u201d vocal samples, though), and is vaguely reminiscent of Jeremih\u2019s great track \u201cDon\u2019t Tell \u2018Em (feat. YG).\u201d The vocals from Tate McRae on this song channel the impressive vocal ranges of Sabrina Carpenter & Jeremih, as Tate sounds like both of them at different points on this song. She does a great job establishing her own sound on this song as well, though. Her flows are great, and her lyrics, which basically discuss how she wants a guy so bad that she\u2019s willing to have him \u201churt [her] feelings,\u201d are great as well. Tate McRae is on an absolute heater right now. Gunning for Taylor Swift\u2019s spot at #2 on the best albums of 2023 list right now.\u201cstay done\u201d: Flashes of the old Tate McRae on this song and the last one, but because of Tate\u2019s very good vocals, these songs are only mid instead of god-awful like they have been in the past. For this track, Ryan Tedder produced a beat that sounded like a song from the soundtrack to Hannah Montana: The Movie or a generic 90\u2019s indie rock acoustic guitar song. From now on, I will be referring to any acoustic guitar beats that sound like they were produced for a 90\u2019s indie rock or post-grunge band as \u201cRufus Humphrey type beats,\u201d as that character from the show Gossip Girl was in a fictional 90\u2019s indie rock band. Anyway, the song isn\u2019t good because the lyrics aren\u2019t good and the production is very boring, but Tate McRae\u2019s very good vocals prevent the song from being any worse than mid.\u201cwe\u2019re not alike\u201d: This song is very interesting. It\u2019s on the bubble of being good, but the 8 rating classifies it as mid. The production on this track from Ido Zmishlany is a stark contrast to the energetic dance-pop party banger \u201cexes,\u201d which has a similar level of confidence and \u201cI\u2019m her\u201d energy from Tate McRae that she exhibited on \u201cgreedy,\u201d but there\u2019s no one thing that can describe this beat. The production has elements of synthpop, soft rock, and Rufus Humphrey type beat, but the fusion of these genres actually works better than I thought it would. The production is average, but Ido Zmishlany\u2019s inventive work kept this song from sounding like an Olivia Rodrigo track, which I greatly appreciate. The lyrics are very Olivia Rodrigo-esque, as this song portrays Tate as sour and vindictive, but her vocals are so good on here that it\u2019s hard to give this track too low of a rating. Although the subject matter and lyrics aren\u2019t good on here, the production was quite intriguing and Tate McRae\u2019s vocals were infectiously good.\u201cmessier\u201d: Unfortunately, Tate McRae\u2019s emo \u201csad girl music\u201d phase that dominated the majority of her last album i used to think i could fly rears its ugly head with this song. The production is contrived, basic, bland, and cookie-cutter emo pop, the vocals are flat and nowhere near as good as they have been for most of this album, and the lyrics are depressing, emo, and trite \u201csad girl pop.\u201d This song is bad, and I\u2019m willing to bet that it was supposed to be on her previous album i used to think i could fly, but got bumped to this album for some reason.\u201cthink later\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good night if you don\u2019t take it too far\u201d Tate McRae emphatically boasts on this bass-heavy, dark song about a good night gone bad. On this song, Tate McRae has thankfully dropped the emo sad girl crap that was present on the last track \u201cmessier,\u201d but instead of making a party banger like \u201cgreedy\u201d & \u201cexes\u201d where she embodies confidence, she portrays herself in a negative light on here with lyrics that detail her falling for a bad boy, abandoning her friends, and making inherently bad decisions that she realizes at the time are bad. Now, I\u2019m all for having a good time and mixing it up, but Tate McRae bragging about being a bad friend and pursuing people she knows are bad news should not be her new image. Trying to make a darker, heavier version of \u201cgreedy\u201d with this song was good in theory, but mid in practice.\u201cguilty conscience\u201d: Unfortunately, this album has taken a pretty drastic downturn since the banger \u201cexes,\u201d as the songs between that one and this one were all very reminiscent of Tate McRae\u2019s previous album and previous emo, whiny, \u201cwoe-is-me,\u201d \u201csad girl pop\u201d music, which I was very disappointed with. Although the title track \u201cthink later\u201d sounded like Tate McRae\u2019s new certified pop superstar sound, the lyrics were not good, the subject matter was dark, and the heavy 808 bass on the instrumental was not good either. However, this song sounds like the new and improved Tate McRae. Her vocals are very good, the chorus is a bit repetitive but a solid, catchy pop chorus, and the lyrics about loving someone until failure in a Bonnie & Clyde type situation are innovative and very different from anything Tate has ever done. The lyrics are good, but there are a few bad lines and too much repetition in some places. Tate\u2019s vocals are mostly good, but she has a few moments where she sounds flat and falters. The production is nothing special on this song, but it\u2019s good enough to get the job done. I\u2019d say this is a solid song and hopefully indicative of a good last few tracks.Tate McRae evolved from a pop star specializing in emo, sad girl pop to a certified pop superstar with this album. Unfortunately, as this album progressed, that transformation became less convincing. On the intro track \u201ccut my hair\u201d (which is one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard from Tate McRae), Tate opens with the chorus \u201cJust wanna cut my hair, lose myself, make you sweat,\u201d and follows that statement of reinvention with the confident line \u201cSad girl bit got a little boring\u201d in the second verse. When I heard these lines, I was absolutely ecstatic. Tate McRae sounded better than she\u2019d ever sounded vocally on this song, and it sounded like she finally wanted to abandon emo pop with this album! The pop party bangers \u201cgreedy\u201d & \u201cexes\u201d and the elegant pop songs \u201crun for the hills\u201d & \u201churt my feelings\u201d further convinced me that Tate McRae wanted to fully abandon emo pop and become a true pop superstar with this album. Now, these songs on their own are enough to cement Tate as a pop superstar, so I\u2019ll repeat the claim that Tate has now achieved superstar status (what she was able to do with Timbaland\u2019s drums and Ryan Tedder\u2019s melody on \u201cgreedy\u201d speaks volumes to what she\u2019s capable of), but the rest of the album showed that Tate hasn\u2019t quite moved on from her emo phase yet. \u201cplastic palm trees\u201d & \u201cmessier\u201d were undoubtedly the most disappointing songs and the most reminiscent of Tate\u2019s previous album i used to think i could fly, but other songs like \u201cgrave\u201d & \u201cstay done\u201d were mid filler where Tate didn\u2019t put in near the amount of effort she should have and resorted to emo lyrics and flat vocals to fill space. Tate McRae started off on a hot streak with this album, and flashes of brilliance like \u201cexes\u201d and even \u201cguilty conscience\u201d kept me interested, but overall, this album won\u2019t be in the conversation for the silver AOTY medal of 2023, and it\u2019s questionable if it\u2019ll even make the top 5.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released December 10, 2021 (Re-Released November 17, 2023)Genres: Synthpop, New Wave, Pop, Rhythm & Blues (R&B)/Soul, Sophisti-Pop, FunkTracks:Enchanted Waterfall \u2013 10Pink Dolphin Sunset (feat.

When Tory Lanez said this album was gonna be an \u201c80\u2019s Pop capsule album,\u201d I was doubtful that he could pull off 80\u2019s Pop as well as The Weeknd, Dua Lipa, Ava Max, and others who have used the synthpop styles of the 80\u2019s in their recent albums, but he really brought the heat on this song. The production from Bizness Boi & Tropics sounds like a mix between The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cIs There Someone Else?\u201d (minus the vocal sample) & George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d with some epic saxophone flourishes and staggeringly cool bass guitar licks thrown in. Both verses from Tory Lanez are great; he pleads a girl to stay with him and realize her feelings for him in a falsetto that he hits excellently well, but the real star of this song is the chorus, which is sung in the same flow as the chorus on George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper.\u201d Tory Lanez\u2019s version isn\u2019t sophisti-pop like George Michael\u2019s; it\u2019s much more R&B, which adds an extra element of smoothness that makes Tory\u2019s version unique and very cool. I had my doubts about this album, as Tory Lanez\u2019s hip-hop and R&B capsule albums Loner and PLAYBOY are rated 4.1 and 6.2 on the page, respectively, but Tory really showed me something with this intro track; I hope he keeps up the good work.\u201cPink Dolphin Sunset (feat. Tee)\u201d: Another song that perfectly encapsulates the sound of 80\u2019s Pop. I\u2019ve gotta say, with these first two tracks on this album, Tory Lanez is giving The Weeknd\u2019s albums After Hours and Dawn FM (both heavily inspired by 80\u2019s Pop) a run for their money. The production from Bizness Boi & Chaz Jackson (I actually know a guy named Chaz Jackson who was in a business communications class with me, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not the same guy) is outstanding. The beat has the 80\u2019s pop \u201cthump-heavy\u201d drum kit that was used on The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cHow Do I Make You Love Me?,\u201d lush synth chords, and echo & delay on Tory Lanez voice that allows for epic vocal samples in the melody. The first verse from Tory Lanez is great, the chorus is great, and the second verse is very good (there is a line or two where Tory falters briefly, but it\u2019s almost unnoticeable). The reason why this song is not a 10 is because of the vocals on the chorus from Tee (not to be confused with Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins). The R&B female vocalist\u2019s refrain of \u201cOoh, baby, ooh, baby, wanna get with you, baby\u201d is delivered somewhat awkwardly and gets in the way of Tory\u2019s far superior vocals. Other than that small thing, this song is great.\u201cMidnight\u2019s Interlude\u201d: The production from Bizness Boi & Chaz Jackson (again, regrettably, not the guy I know), which leans heavily on a sample of the line \u201cI can\u2019t feel my heart, again, when I\u2019m with you\u201d from the previous track \u201cPink Dolphin Sunset (feat. Tee),\u201d is good, but a little sloppy on this song. The vocal sample is ethereally arranged with flanger and phaser effects, but the sample speeds up and slows down at weird times, which makes the sample use much less effective. The same drum kit as the last song is used on here, and it sounds really good, but the vocal sample\u2019s inconsistency really knocks the production. The lyrics are very repetitive and the vocals are only good for a few lines; as Tory Lanez adopts a weird vocal cadence for the lines \u201cOh, why don\u2019t you want my love? / Why don\u2019t you want me, baby?,\u201d and that line is repeated for about half the track. The outro lines are delivered very well, in a vocal cadence that\u2019s almost reminiscent of Chris Brown or Michael Jackson, which is really cool, but this track is definitely not Tory Lanez\u2019s strongest. It\u2019s still good, but not one of the better tracks I\u2019ve heard so far.\u201cThe Color Violet\u201d: \u201cI gave my heart / Speedin\u2019 car, goin\u2019 90 in the rain / She took my heart, filled it with nothin\u2019 but pain / This beat and my dance, it\u2019s not for romance / I wanna stay but, playboys, we don\u2019t dance, dance, dance\u201d Tory Lanez sings evocatively in a smooth, sultry falsetto on the chorus of this awesome song. The production from Nik Dean & Foreign Teck, which includes deep, ethereal, lush synth chords, a very subtle synth melody, a spacey drum pattern, and saxophone flourishes, is absolutely incredible and completely captures the essence of an 80\u2019s R&B or Pop ballad. Tory Lanez does an excellent job on his two verses on this song, an incredible job on the chorus (which shares some subject matter with George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d just like the intro track), and the saxophone solo from Nik Dean at the end of the song is absolutely amazing, especially when paired with the spacey synths. Epic track.\u201cLavender Sunflower\u201d: This track sounds like a mid Chris Brown song. Tory Lanez uses a similar vocal cadence to Chris Brown on this song, has mid lyrics on the verses and bad lyrics on the chorus, and the production from Bizness Boi isn\u2019t anything special. While this song sounds like it could be an 80\u2019s Pop track with its synth-heavy instrumental, it sounds more like it could\u2019ve been featured on Chris Brown\u2019s 2023 album 11:11, which had a ton of filler and songs that sounded exactly like this one, with similar vocals, lyrics, and production.\u201cBallad Of A Badman\u201d: This song is basically Tory Lanez\u2019s version of The Weeknd\u2019s 80\u2019s Pop inspired smash hit banger \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d and while it isn\u2019t as good as The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d it\u2019s still a very good song. Although Chaz Jackson & Jet Stanley sampled the drum pattern directly from \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d the saxophone flourishes and peppy synths add nuance to this track and make it sound different. Both songs sound great and like they could\u2019ve been hits in the 80\u2019s just as much as they\u2019re hits now. The chorus from Tory Lanez is great, his two verses are very good as well (the upbeat and positive lyrics sound similar to The Weeknd\u2019s on \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d but they are uniquely Tory\u2019s and talk about always wanting a girl around), and Tory\u2019s bridge, which is accented by some awesome saxophone work from Chaz Jackson, is incredible. The saxophone from Chaz Jackson on this track is absolutely awesome, and it\u2019s the main thing that keeps this track from sounding exactly like The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cBlinding Lights.\u201d Great song by Tory Lanez; although he might\u2019ve taken a great deal of inspiration from The Weeknd, this track is a unique, 80\u2019s Pop banger.\u201cLady Of Namek\u201d: This song\u2019s subject matter exemplifies the title of the album more than any other track so far, as Tory Lanez talks about his prom date deserting him and leaving him alone at the dance instead of going home with him. The vocals on this song are average, the lyrics are good at best, and the chorus is average at best. The production on this track from Chaz Jackson has a signature 80\u2019s Pop sound, but unfortunately, Tory Lanez\u2019s vocal performance and lyrics don\u2019t do the beat justice. It\u2019s even more unfortunate considering how this song basically exemplifies the \u201calone at prom\u201d concept with its subject matter. Mid track.\u201cPluto\u2019s Last Comet\u201d: The production from Chaz Jackson & Orlando Williamson samples Madonna\u2019s \u201cInto The Groove\u201d, and on the verses, Tory Lanez samples Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d with his flow! Absolutely awesome track that perfectly captures the essence of 80\u2019s Pop. The production from Chaz Jackson & Orlando Williamson mostly relies on the drum pattern and synth lead from Madonna\u2019s \u201cInto The Groove,\u201d but there are a few extra effects, mainly drums and synth chords, added by Chaz Jackson that provide nuance and make this song unique to Tory Lanez. The two verses from Tory are great, as he not only uses the flow from Rick Astley\u2019s iconic \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up,\u201d but also sings about crushing hard on a girl who won\u2019t reciprocate his love in a smooth, silky falsetto. The chorus, which applies heavy echo and delay effects on Tory\u2019s vocals and the ad-libs, is awesome, and the post-chorus, which has non-lyric vocals from Tory along with echo and delay effects on the ad-libs, is just as amazing. Just like he did with \u201cEnchanted Waterfall,\u201d Tory Lanez took a classic 80\u2019s Pop song (two classic 80\u2019s Pop songs in this case) and redefined it according to his vision. Epic song.\u201c\u201887 Stingray\u201d: On a track named after the 1987 Chevrolet Stingray Corvette (an awesome car), Tory Lanez gives a performance that\u2019s average at best over some very good production from Chaz Jackson & Orlando Williamson. The first verse from Tory Lanez is very good and helps establish his presence on this song, but it\u2019s too short and bleeds into the pre-chorus. When the pre-chorus hits, everything goes downhill. The pre-chorus and chorus both have mid lyrics, mid vocals, and flows that don\u2019t match this beat, which is a synth-based 80\u2019s dance-pop instrumental that shows the production talents of Chaz Jackson yet again. The second verse from Tory Lanez is average, as it\u2019s another short verse where Tory tries to establish his presence again after a repetitive and drawn-out chorus, but the lyrics and flow on this verse aren\u2019t very good. While the production from Chaz Jackson & Orlando Williamson is very good on this song, Tory Lanez falters on the pre-chorus and chorus, and lets those mid performances overshadow verses that were too short.\u201cLast Kiss Of Nebulon\u201d: Chaz Jackson & Orlando Williamson are back at it again with another insanely epic 80\u2019s Pop sample: \u201cEasy Lover\u201d by Philip Bailey & Phil Collins, which is supplemented by a funky bass guitar and peppy synths that play brilliantly off the sample. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the false start that happens on the refrain, which serves as the intro and the break after the second chorus, but the falsetto vocals from Tory Lanez on the refrain are excellent, so I can\u2019t knock the song too much for that poorly executed false start. The two verses from Tory Lanez and the pre-chorus are all excellent, as Tory adopts a mildly faster-paced version of Phil Collins\u2019 \u201cEasy Lover\u201d flow on these parts and does an excellent job. The chorus is good, as Tory adopts a version of Philip Bailey\u2019s \u201cEasy Lover\u201d falsetto flow on it, but some of the lyrics aren\u2019t great and Tory\u2019s vocal delivery is a bit off on a few parts. However, the production from Chaz Jackson & Orlando Williamson is excellent (minus the weird false start on the refrain), and Tory Lanez does a great job adapting Philip Bailey & Phil Collins\u2019 smooth 80\u2019s Pop classic to this song, which is a bit faster paced, more intense, and with more R&B. Whereas \u201cEasy Lover\u201d shows Philip Bailey & Phil Collins being ensnared by the charm of a playgirl, this song shows Tory Lanez breaking up with a girl and wanting to have sex with her one final time before he vindictively does what she did to him. Great song and great closer for the original album.\u201cProm King // Love On Acid (feat. Mr. Talkbox)\u201d: The first section, \u201cProm King,\u201d is another example of why Chaz Jackson deserves to be in the conversation of my top 10 producers of all time, as this section samples \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville. Evocative grand piano chords, a melodic and smooth saxophone lick from Chaz Jackson, and silky smooth vocals from Tory Lanez dominate this part of the song, and Tory more than does the original song justice. I think this version is actually superior to the original \u201cForever Young,\u201d as the \u201calone at prom\u201d concept is perfectly exemplified in this section, as Tory is a senior prom king dancing with his queen one last time before graduation. The transition is jarring, but the talkbox interlude from Mr. Talkbox smooths it over brilliantly. The second section, \u201cLove On Acid,\u201d is just as good as the first section despite not having an 80\u2019s Pop sample. The instrumental from Chaz Jackson is absolutely excellent; it\u2019s ethereal with brilliant synth melodies, talkbox ad-libs and harmonies from Mr. Talkbox, and great saxophone licks from Chaz Jackson. The lyrics and vocals from Tory Lanez are straight out of The Weeknd\u2019s After Hours & Dawn FM playbook, and Tory Lanez does an amazing job building his own sound while sounding like The Weeknd. Absolutely amazing song, as both parts could stand on their own and be 10s, but together, they\u2019re pure 80\u2019s Pop bliss.\u201cCrystal Strawberry\u201d: The vocals, lyrics, and subject matter on this track sound like a mix between a Chris Brown song and a Lionel Richie song, and Tory Lanez does a great job on this song flushing out his own sound while taking influence from both of these artists. The verses on this track are great, and the production from Bizness Boi & Chaz Jackson; a smooth, funky, laid-back 80\u2019s Pop instrumental with talkbox and drums sampled from Billy Idol\u2019s \u201cEyes Without A Face\u201d; is amazing as well. The chorus, however, is an anticlimactic letdown, as the instrumental doesn\u2019t build to a climax and Tory Lanez\u2019s vocals are flat. Other than the chorus, this song is great, including another awesome beat from Bizness Boi & Chaz Jackson, as well as some great vocals and lyrics.\u201cWilona\u2019s Workshop\u201d: A funky, smooth, R&B track with fast-paced, heavy-reverb snares, funky bass guitar, short, sweet synths in a catchy melody, and some short saxophone riffs from Chaz Jackson during the last chorus that complete this song\u2019s sense of vague familiarity. This track sounds like a lot of different artists simultaneously; Tory Lanez establishes himself on this track with great falsetto vocals, awesome lyrics, and some great harmonizing (on the chorus especially), but the production on this song from Chaz Jackson & Motion Jones is heavily influenced by Quincy Jones. As a result, the song sounds like the King Of Pop Michael Jackson\u2019s Quincy Jones-produced albums Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad, but this track also sounds like The Weeknd\u2019s Dawn FM songs \u201cOut Of Time\u201d & \u201cI Heard You\u2019re Married (feat. Lil Wayne).\u201d Throw some influence from Toto\u2019s \u201cRosanna\u201d in there, and you\u2019ve got an accurate description of this song. The lighthearted lyrics, smooth flow, and great falsetto vocals from Tory Lanez are all amazing and serve to make this track a catchy 80\u2019s Pop banger where Tory spits game to a girl, telling her he\u2019d be willing to take a break from his playboy lifestyle to be with her. Great track, kind of a weird name, though.\u201cHurts Me (with Trippie Redd feat. Yoko Gold)\u201d: Well, I think I finally discovered a genre that Trippie Redd is not bad at: 80\u2019s Pop produced by Chaz Jackson (who is seriously looking to crack my top 10 GOAT producers list pretty soon) and featuring Tory Lanez. Trippie Redd is often mocked for being the most versatile artists ever because he\u2019s bad in every genre, but on this song, Trippie Redd doesn\u2019t sound as bad as he usually does. Granted, 80\u2019s Pop is such a beloved genre with so many awesome sounds and great production that it\u2019s hard to mess up, but Trippie Redd holds his own next to Tory Lanez & Yoko Gold. The chorus from Tory Lanez isn\u2019t one of his better ones; it\u2019s good at best, so the show is pretty much stolen by Yoko Gold & Trippie Redd, who handle the post-chorus. Yoko Gold passionately sings \u201cYeah, you got what you need, and then you never came back around\u201d twice, and it\u2019s awesome, and Trippie Redd sings the lines that surround that, which are \u201cOutta mind, outta sight\u201d that comes before it, and \u201cNow you got what you need, now it\u2019s outta mind, outta sight.\u201d Trippie Redd sounds more like Travis Scott than he does himself on these lines, and it\u2019s awesome. Although his emo, whiny, moaning vocal delivery comes out on the last part of the last line, he subdues it long enough that he does well against Yoko Gold, and the post-chorus ends up being the highlight of the song. While this track isn\u2019t one of the best ones on the album, it\u2019s good, and it\u2019s a huge W for Trippie Redd, who is still in desperate need of a change from his low-rent psychedelic emo rap trash that he usually does.\u201cAlexa Loves It (feat. Mr. Talkbox)\u201d: These collaborations with talkbox master Mr. Talkbox are absolutely amazing; Mr. Talkbox\u2019s masterful work with backing vocals, ad-libs, and harmonies throughout this track and \u201cProm King // Love On Acid (feat. Mr. Talkbox)\u201d add an extra layer of complexity and greatness to these already epic tracks. Tory Lanez\u2019s two verses on here are great, as his silky smooth flow, falsetto vocals, and playful yet seductive lyrics are amazing, but the chorus is a little repetitive and the flows aren\u2019t great on there. Mr. Talkbox\u2019s great work with the talkbox definitely makes up for the repetition and lack of strong flow from Tory on the chorus, but it\u2019s definitely a weaker point in the song. Regardless, this song is absolutely amazing and only a few points were lost from the chorus. A beautiful tribute to Tory Lanez\u2019s late friend Alexa, a lover of 80\u2019s Pop to whom this album is dedicated.\u201cPoison Ivy\u201d: Michael Jackson vocal cadence on the verses, Bell Biv DeVoe vocal cadence on the pre-chorus, and New Edition vocal cadence on the chorus! With a sample and the subject matter of Bell Biv DeVoe\u2019s \u201cPoison,\u201d Tory Lanez acts as a one-man R&B boy band, as he channels some of the most iconic Pop / R&B acts of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s on this song. The chorus and pre-chorus are both absolute gold, but there are some lyrics on the verses that are basic, contrived, and don\u2019t make much sense, and while Tory Lanez\u2019s Michael Jackson vocal cadence and flow are on point, some of the bad lyrics distract from what he\u2019s trying to do. This song is absolutely awesome and one of the best tributes to MJ I\u2019ve heard in a while, but a few of the parts could\u2019ve been better. I\u2019ve gotta say, though, I didn\u2019t expect the sample of \u201cPoison\u201d by Bell Biv DeVoe, but I should have considering this song\u2019s title, and the sample was used extremely well.\u201cKAME HOUSE\u201d: Even on the final track of the album, Tory Lanez is continuing to push the boundaries of this 80\u2019s Pop concept album with new styles, new flows, new vocal cadences, and new producers. Although Motion Jones had collabed with Chaz Jackson on a track earlier on this album, this song is Motion Jones\u2019 first track as the sole producer in the production credits. Over this ethereal, spacey instrumental with downtempo synths and sporadic, spaced-out drums, Tory Lanez channels Sade\u2019s sophisti-pop sound (specifically the flow from Sade\u2019s \u201cSmooth Operator\u201d) and makes a track that\u2019s one of the smoothest on this album, if not the smoothest. The subdued guitar solos from Motion Jones at the end of the track are amazingly well done, and they play brilliantly off of Tory Lanez\u2019s seductive, sultry, and silky vocal delivery on this song. The subdued guitar solo amidst this ethereal sophisti-pop instrumental sounds either like the late great Def Leppard guitarist Steve Clark was featured on a Sade song, or like something Metro Boomin would do (and, in fact, has done on his song \u201cBorrowed Love (feat. Swae Lee & Wizkid)\u201d). Great way to end a great album.This album won\u2019t qualify for being one of the best in 2023 because it was originally released in 2021 and had its deluxe edition released in 2023, nearly two years after the original dropped, but in all honesty, I wish it qualified as a 2023 album release because this album was truly one of the best to come out in 2023. Going into this album, I was skeptical that Tory Lanez could make an album that accurately captured 80\u2019s Pop, more specifically, the synthpop, sophisti-pop, and funky R&B that dominated pop music in the 1980\u2019s, but those feelings of skepticism were quickly dismissed when I heard this album\u2019s opening track. I went into this album wondering if Tory Lanez could compete with the likes of The Weeknd, Ava Max, Dua Lipa, and others who have done 80\u2019s Pop so well in their music, but now, I\u2019m thinking those artists could learn a thing or two from Tory Lanez. It\u2019s no understatement to say that this album is Tory Lanez\u2019s best project, as it\u2019s his most inventive, most musically diverse, most complex, and just overall best. On his other albums, Tory Lanez often struggles to find a balance between being a singer and being a rapper. He\u2019s a good singer and a good rapper, but his lyrics are often vapid, annoying, generic, and contrived, which causes many people (myself included) to dismiss him as the bargain-brand version of Drake & The Weeknd (as Tory Lanez is also from Toronto like those two superstar titans). On this album, Tory Lanez creates a persona, similar to what The Weeknd did on After Hours and Dawn FM. Tory becomes Ashton Rain, 80\u2019s Pop R&B singer, and it allows him to drop the whole singer / rapper question and make songs that sound like they could\u2019ve been on the radio in between tracks by The King Of Pop MJ, The Queen Of Pop Madonna, Lionel Richie, El DeBarge, New Edition, The Bangles, The Go-Go\u2019s, Cyndi Lauper, New Order, and countless other artists who defined pop in the 80\u2019s and for years to come. To put it in perspective, here are some of the 80\u2019s songs sampled on this album: \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d by George Michael (on the intro track \u201cEnchanted Waterfall\u201d), \u201cInto The Groove\u201d by Madonna & \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d by Rick Astley (both sampled on \u201cPluto\u2019s Last Comet\u201d), \u201cEasy Lover\u201d by Philip Bailey & Phil Collins (on the regular album outro track \u201cLast Kiss Of Nebulon\u201d), \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville (on the epic two-parter \u201cProm King // Love On Acid (feat. Mr. Talkbox)\u201d), and \u201cPoison\u201d by Bell Biv DeVoe (on the Michael Jackson-esque \u201cPoison Ivy\u201d). It\u2019s one thing to sample these songs, but to make reimagined bangers where you establish your own sound with each one of them? That\u2019s another thing entirely, and not something to be taken lightly at all. I still prefer some of the originals, but I\u2019ve gotta say, I prefer some of Tory\u2019s versions over the original 80\u2019s songs. \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville got washed by Tory Lanez\u2019s \u201cProm King // Love On Acid (feat. Mr. Talkbox),\u201d and Tory Lanez\u2019s \u201cEnchanted Waterfall\u201d gave George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d a serious run for its money. I\u2019m not sure if I can say Tory\u2019s version is better, but they\u2019re both at least equally good. With frequent collaborator Chaz Jackson, a hip-hop / R&B producer and saxophonist, Tory Lanez absolutely shines with gorgeous falsetto vocals, sensual and seductive lyrics, and playful flows over production that leans heavily on reverbed drums, synths, and saxophones. Chaz Jackson has now officially joined my top 10 all-time GOAT producers list just from this album, as his beats are so incredibly awesome that it would be a crime not to put him in the top 10 all-time GOAT producers list alongside Timbaland, Metro Boomin, Travis Scott, Kanye West, Teddy Riley, Hit-Boy, Pharrell Williams, 40, and The Weeknd. The original section of this album is good, but there are a few songs where Tory Lanez sounds like he\u2019s making a mid Chris Brown or MJ song, and I don\u2019t even know what he was doing on \u201cHurt From Mercury (feat. NYCE).\u201d The deluxe edition is where this album really separates itself and achieves true greatness, though. With only a single bad song in the repetitive and mundane \u201cSplash.Wave.Repeat (Interlude),\u201d Tory Lanez continues his link ups with Chaz Jackson, but also recruits fellow 80\u2019s Pop enthusiast and the master of the talkbox Mr. Talkbox for four collaborations. Each one of these collabs is awesome, as they all remind me of Mr. Talkbox\u2019s Michael Jackson covers on YouTube and make me think what it could\u2019ve been like if Mr. Talkbox had worked with MJ and Quincy Jones in the 80\u2019s. Tory\u2019s two collabs with frequent collaborator Yoko Gold are both awesome, as Yoko Gold sounds in his element on this album and these beats just as much as Tory is. On the deluxe edition, Tory channels everyone from Michael Jackson, New Edition, and Bell Biv DeVoe on \u201cPoison Ivy\u201d to Sade on \u201cKAME HOUSE,\u201d and the result is no solo songs under 9 (with the exception of that atrocious interlude). Overall, it isn\u2019t far-fetched at all to say this album is Tory Lanez\u2019s best project, and since Tory Lanez is now in prison facing a lengthy sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the foot, this album will likely (and hopefully) be his musical legacy.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released November 10, 2023Genres: Emo, Pop, Pop Rap, Trap, Soft Rock, PsychedeliaTracks:SORRY \u2013 8BLEED \u2013 9.6I THOUGHT I NEEDED YOU \u2013 7.4WHERE DO YOU SLEEP? \u2013 6.8TOO MUCH (feat.

This track sounds nothing like the whiny, emo, overly dramatic, \u201cwoe-is-me,\u201d Juice WRLD clone music The Kid LAROI made on his previous three albums. This song, with its chopped-up soul sample instrumental produced by frequent Kanye West collaborators BoogzDaBeast & FNZ, sounds more like a song from Kanye West\u2019s Donda than any song The Kid LAROI has ever made. This track is heavily influenced by Drake as well, as it has a similar flow and similar subject matter to most of Drake\u2019s intro tracks, and The Kid LAROI uses similar vocal cadences to Drake multiple times on this song as well. The first part of the song definitely has better lyrics and flows than the second part; after the drums kick in and the chopped-up soul sample takes a backseat to the fast-paced drum pattern, The Kid LAROI\u2019s lyrics and flows regress and revert to a less intense but still present emo rap flow. This song is too good to be classified solely as \u201cmid,\u201d but it\u2019s not good enough for me to call it a \u201cgood song.\u201d Solid 8 for this inventive intro track.\u201cBLEED\u201d: \u201cHow did your heart mend so easy? / Mine still bleeds / Hard to believe you don\u2019t need me\u201d The Kid LAROI sings beautifully and evocatively on the amazing chorus of this song. The production on this track, which is a smooth and laid-back acoustic guitar melody and constant yet mellow acoustic drum pattern, is amazing and sounds more like a soft rock song or pop ballad than any emo rap song The Kid LAROI has ever made. This song is definitely the best track The Kid LAROI has ever made, hands down. He\u2019s never made a track in the 9\u2019s before, but this one had potential to even be a 10 with its great lyrics, great vocals, and heartstring-pulling subject matter. The only thing that prevents this song from being a 10 is The Kid LAROI\u2019s whiny, wailing, emo vocals that come out during the second verse and completely ruin the illusion that The Kid LAROI was a smooth and sultry singer. A bit of a bag fumble on The Kid LAROI\u2019s part there, but this is still an excellent song.\u201cI THOUGHT THAT I NEEDED YOU\u201d: Okay, this song might\u2019ve been good if not for the rage production with an acoustic guitar melody and pop vocals sample from BNYX\u00ae & F1LTHY. The lyrics and subject matter from The Kid LAROI on this song, which talk about a failed relationship that went on too long because The Kid LAROI wasn\u2019t ready to let go of the girl, did not go with the fast-paced rage production at all, and this track sounded like a mashup of a BNYX\u00ae or F1LTHY-produced song with an emo pop song. The Kid LAROI\u2019s vocals weren\u2019t great on here either, and his lyrics were hit and miss on this track as well, so it\u2019s not entirely the fault of BNYX\u00ae & F1LTHY on this song, but their errant production certainly didn\u2019t help. Rage drum & 808 patterns mixed with a pop vocal sample and acoustic guitar melody was not a good decision, and this track suffered because of that decision.\u201cTOO MUCH (feat. Central Cee & Jung Kook)\u201d: With this song and \u201cWHERE DO YOU SLEEP?,\u201d The Kid LAROI is regressing and returning to his old style of whiny, emo, overly dramatic, \u201cwoe-is-me,\u201d Juice WRLD clone music. Although \u201cWHERE DO YOU SLEEP?\u201d had great production from FNZ that included a few ethereal synth breaks and had two beat switches where the second and third beats resembled the ethereal first and soul-sampling second beats of Travis Scott\u2019s classic banger \u201c90210 (feat. Kacy Hill),\u201d The Kid LAROI managed to mess it up with mid lyrics, whiny and emo vocals, and mid flows. On this song, everything is generic, basic, and contrived. The chorus from BTS member Jung Kook is bland and flavorless, the first and third verses from The Kid LAROI have mid lyrics, whiny, emo, and overly dramatic vocals, and mid flows, and the second verse from Central Cee has some very out-of-pocket lines and a flow that doesn\u2019t fit this watered-down soul-sample beat that sounds like generic pop rap or something Jung Kook would put out. Not a good song and a total regression for The Kid LAROI.\u201cNIGHTS LIKE THIS\u201d: Ethereal, psychedelic, and spacey production from the master and architect of the modern cloud rap sound himself: Clams Casino, who got his start producing insanely awesome beats for Lil B that Lil B always proceeded to crap all over because he\u2019s a terrible rapper. This beat from Clams Casino is awesome, and The Kid LAROI\u2019s vocals and lyrics on this song were very good as well. The Kid LAROI adopts a high-pitched vocal cadence for the chorus on this track, but it works very well juxtaposed with the deep synths and reverb-heavy 808 pattern of this ethereal beat. I was thinking this song would sample or be similar to Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cImpossible,\u201d as the chorus of that song repeats the phrase \u201cnights like this,\u201d but this track is great in its own way. I\u2019m glad to see The Kid LAROI continuing to branch out and attempting another psychedelic track on this album.\u201cWHAT\u2019S THE MOVE (feat. BabyDrill & Future)\u201d: First verse from The Kid LAROI is outstanding; probably his best rap verse in the history of his career. His lyrics, flow, and vocal delivery are all great on that verse. However, his chorus is good at best, as it\u2019s a bit whiny, the emo vocal cadence returns, and the lyrics have a bit of an emo sound to them and aren\u2019t that great. The production on this song from FNZ & Dopamine is very cool, as the melody, which is based on a chopped-up vocal sample, could either be used for trap or drill, as the melody sounds like it could be used on a drill beat, but they opted for trap on this song, as the trap drums are extremely well-executed on here. Second verse from Future is good, as he adopts a kind of weird vocal cadence at the beginning of the verse and takes a few lines to find his footing on this beat, and even after he does, it\u2019s nothing special. Third verse from BabyDrill was mid and completely unnecessary, as he contributed nothing to the song and completely screwed up the sound of the track with an offbeat verse and lines that only reiterated what The Kid LAROI & Future had already said. Good song overall, though; The Kid LAROI makes a very convincing case for him being a rapper with this track.\u201cCALL ME INSTEAD (feat. Robert Glasper & YoungBoy Never Broke Again)\u201d: I knew the production on this song was gonna be fire, as Robert Glasper, award-winning jazz multi-instrumentalist and frequent collaborator of Terrace Martin, James Fauntleroy and Kendrick Lamar, almost always does well with melodies, and with the piano melody on this track, he did an excellent job. If Robert Glasper\u2019s \u201cBlack Superhero (feat. Big K.R.I.T., BJ The Chicago Kid & Killer Mike)\u201d from the Madden 23 soundtrack is any indication, his piano melodies are always on point. The chorus from The Kid LAROI is great on this track, as his vocals are very good and the lyrics are great as well, but his first verse is mid. The lyrics, vocals, and vocal delivery on that verse are all overly dramatic, overly emo, and just not good. The second verse from YoungBoy Never Broke Again was absolutely awful, as his whiny, nasally, and dumb vocal cadence sounded absolutely ridiculous against Robert Glasper\u2019s gentle piano melody. The lyrics were terrible, the flow was trash, and the vocals were hilariously bad. Good production and good chorus, but everything else about this track was bad.\u201cTHE LINE (feat. d4vd)\u201d: Another soft rock beat with an acoustic guitar melody and a very subtle drum pattern that\u2019s almost non-existent where The Kid LAROI slows down and sings in a subdued vocal cadence. R&B singer d4vd is featured for the chorus and first verse, and his vocals sound like a combination of Brent Faiyaz & GIV\u0112ON if they were mixed with an indie pop flow. d4vd does a good job on the chorus with vocals and lyrics, but the first verse is good at best, as his flow and vocals sound a bit boring. The Kid LAROI isn\u2019t much better with his second verse, as his flow is all over the place and his vocals are over-the-top and too dramatic for this very mellow and subdued instrumental. Mid song, but d4vd was intriguing; I\u2019ll be interested to hear more from him in the future.\u201cYOU (feat. Kacy Hill)\u201d: Best parts of the song are the Kacy Hill non-lyric vocals that are almost an extension of the beat, the heavily-reverbed synth outro that sounds like the work of Kacy Hill or MIKE DEAN (but it\u2019s the work of Kacy in the style of MIKE DEAN), and the chorus from The Kid LAROI. The Kid LAROI\u2019s vocals on the chorus match the cadence of Kacy Hill\u2019s non-lyric vocals, and he sounds great when he\u2019s reaching into the high registers he hits on that chorus. Lyrics are good as well. Unfortunately, on both of the verses on this song, The Kid LAROI reverts to his old ways of emo vocal delivery and flows, having overly dramatic and whiny flows and vocals on both verses along with mid lyrics. This song would\u2019ve been good if the verses had even been a little better, but they both sucked, which left Kacy Hill with a burden she couldn\u2019t carry.While this album isn\u2019t good, it\u2019s undoubtedly The Kid LAROI\u2019s best album. It\u2019s his most diverse and complex album in terms of lyrics, flows, vocals, and musical styles, as well as features. I wasn\u2019t surprised to see YoungBoy Never Broke Again on this album, as the two have collaborated before, but UK drill rapper Central Cee? Former BTS member and international pop superstar Jung Kook? Modern jazz legend Robert Glasper? Art pop singer and Travis Scott & Kid Cudi collaborator Kacy Hill? I never expected any of those people to show up on the same album, let alone an album by The Kid LAROI. I\u2019ve gotta admit, I didn\u2019t believe The Kid LAROI when he said this album was gonna be \u201cnothing like his previous albums\u201d and that his previous albums were \u201cimmature,\u201d but he surprised me with just how different this album was from his previous albums. He really delivered on that statement (albeit it was a bit of a hyperbole, as there were some songs on this album that sounded like his old music and had the same emo, \u201cedgy,\u201d overly dramatic, whiny, and \u201cwoe-is-me\u201d sound to them). The Kid LAROI\u2019s best songs on this album (and of all time) were songs where he tried new stuff. \u201cBLEED,\u201d a soft rock ballad, was the best song on this album and in The Kid LAROI\u2019s discography; \u201cNIGHTS LIKE THIS,\u201d a Clams Casino-produced psychedelic song, was the second best; and the third best was \u201cWHAT\u2019S THE MOVE? (feat. BabyDrill & Future),\u201d a collab where The Kid LAROI made the best case for him being considered a rapper in the history of his career, as he out-rapped Future & BabyDrill on this song. Although Omar Fedi & Dopamine returned for the majority of this album, I think The Kid LAROI benefitted from getting some new producers on this album. Although Omar Fedi & Dopamine returned for the majority of this album, I think The Kid LAROI benefitted from getting some new producers on this album. Although the collabs with BNYX\u00ae & Robert Glasper ultimately didn\u2019t pan out, I appreciate the effort to mix it up by The Kid LAROI, and his collabs with BoogzDaBeast & FNZ proved successful. Overall, I really like this new direction for The Kid LAROI and I hope he moves further away from the emo Juice WRLD clone he\u2019s been labeled as on his next album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released November 17, 2023Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Trap, Dirty SouthTracks:G6 \u2013 5.5Big Diamonds (feat. 21 Savage) \u2013 4.2Presha \u2013 3.6Long Story Short \u2013 8.4Millions From Now \u2013 9.4Crazy Thick \u2013 6.9Transparency (feat.

The first section, where Lil Wayne gives a verse, has a very bad beat driven by a weird and twangy sitar melody and a generic trap drum pattern that clashes massively with the sitar melody. The verse from Lil Wayne is mid at best, but he had one line that was particularly good: \u201cTo be safe, none of my guns on safety / Who the f*** I look like, Ed Reed?\u201d (which is a reference to the legendary Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed). The second section, where 2 Chainz gives a verse, has another very bad beat driven by a mockingly grandiose and operatic vocal sample with overly dramatic singing, a weird \u201cbeeping synth\u201d melody, and another generic trap drum pattern that might just be recycled from the first section. 2 Chainz also introduces this section in an extremely cringy way: After the sampled Nicki Minaj interlude, the Mario Kart countdown starts, and at the end, 2 Chainz yells \u201cToni!\u201d in the cringiest voice he can possibly use. His verse is mid, but it\u2019s slightly better than Lil Wayne\u2019s because there aren\u2019t quite as many bad lines. Not off to a good start at all with this very bad song.\u201cBig Diamonds (feat. 21 Savage)\u201d: Terrible chorus from 21 Savage, bad verses from Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz, and a mid verse from 21 Savage brought together by a trash beat. This album has produced two trash tracks in a row, with this one being even worse than the intro. The production on this song is terrible, as the reverb-heavy trumpet melody and clap-heavy drum pattern are both horribly executed. The first verse from Lil Wayne has bad lyrics and bad flows, the second verse from 2 Chainz is the same way (plus a very weird, \u201cgoofy aah\u201d vocal cadence that 2 Chainz adopts halfway through the verse where he makes his voice sound grainy and almost like he\u2019s yelling), and the chorus from 21 Savage is phoned-in and half-baked with bad lyrics and flows. The third verse from 21 Savage is mid, but it\u2019s better than both Lil Wayne\u2019s and 2 Chainz\u2019s verses, and a few of the references he makes to his hometown of Atlanta are somewhat cool. 21 Savage\u2019s verse ultimately has bad lyrics and a half-baked flow, though. He sounded like he didn\u2019t want to be on this song, and judging from the terrible production and awful verses from Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz, I don\u2019t blame him. This track is garbage.\u201cPresha\u201d: Probably the worst beat Bangladesh has ever made. This album is 0 for 3 with production (and with songs in general), but this beat might be the worst one I\u2019ve heard yet. Why did Bangladesh think it was a good idea to do a fast-paced whistle as the melody for this track? Whistling can be a good melody if it\u2019s used correctly, like on \u201cWind Of Change\u201d by Scorpions or \u201cWhistle\u201d by Flo Rida, but with this song, it just sounds ridiculous and takes away from the verses from Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz. However, there\u2019s not too much to hear from Lil Wayne or 2 Chainz on this track, though. The chorus from 2 Chainz is egregiously bad and extremely repetitive and 2 Chainz\u2019s first verse is bad with trash lyrics and flows. The second verse from Lil Wayne is mid at best, as there are a few redeeming qualities to it. Wayne\u2019s signature lighter flick really hyped me up for the verse, and once Lil Wayne got over the hump of being offbeat for the first 15 seconds of the verse, he really found a groove and was rapping well, even with the garbage beat. The lyrics weren\u2019t good and the flows were all over the place, but Lil Wayne did somewhat well in the middle part of the verse. Overall, another terrible song.\u201cLong Story Short\u201d: Finally, a good song for 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne. I certainly hope the first three songs were flukes because this song sounds much more like what I\u2019d expect from a song by 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne. The production from Juicy J, Mannie Fresh & Big K.R.I.T. blends a chopped-up soul sample with a Memphis rage drum pattern, and it works well. This beat is the best one on the album so far, but it\u2019s good and not great, as the soul chops could\u2019ve been executed better and the Memphis rage style should\u2019ve been a bit more prominent (the only thing that really indicated that this song had production from Juicy J was the refrain from Lil Wayne before his first verse, which he did in the flow and vocal cadence of Juicy J). The first verse from Lil Wayne was good; he sounded relaxed, comfortable, and in his element with his laid-back flow and almost effortless lyrical gymnastics. Some of the lyrics could\u2019ve been better, as Lil Wayne has gotten much more vulgar with his sex metaphors in recent years, and I wish he would tone it down a bit in that department, but it\u2019s still a good verse. The second verse from 2 Chainz is good as well, as he sounded like he was in his element and was relaxed and comfortable just like Wayne. The lyrics and flows on this verse were both good, as 2 Chainz sounds like he\u2019s reflecting on his long career and how his exploits have rewarded him with a wife, kids, and the ability to continue making music for a living. He also ends the verse with a reference to the first Collegrove album, which I hope means more songs like this one and the first Collegrove album and less songs like the first three on the album.\u201cMillions From Now\u201d: Great production with a triumphant trumpet melody and a solid drum pattern, great chorus and first verse from 2 Chainz, and an average at best second verse from Lil Wayne. The great lyrics, flows, and \u201cget-up-and-go\u201d attitude exhibited by 2 Chainz on his chorus and verse were absolutely incredible and exactly the shot in the arm this album needed to get back on track. 2 Chainz has always been good at making hype music with triumphant trumpet-based instrumentals, and this song is just another testament to that. 2 Chainz really found a rhythm and did extremely well on this track, but Lil Wayne really couldn\u2019t get into a rhythm on here. When his verse started after 2 Chainz\u2019s great chorus, he sounded almost like he\u2019d been caught off guard and didn\u2019t know he was supposed to start rapping. He fumbled around and said some nonsense in heavy auto-tune through most of his verse, and though he got it together for a few lines, they were few and far between. Lil Wayne got carried by 2 Chainz and the great production on this track, but I\u2019m cool with it because this song was great.\u201cCrazy Thick\u201d: It\u2019s a strip club anthem for sure, as the vulgar lyrics, subject matter about a girl with a big a$$, and clap-heavy drum pattern clearly make it one, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as some of the other songs on this album. 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne are both strip club connoisseurs, so it would stand to reason that when they make strip club anthems, they tend to do it better than everyone else. The spoken intro and vocal distortions on the bridges in this track are all cringe and ridiculous, but Lil Wayne\u2019s chorus, despite its vulgar lyrics, is good, as the auto-tune harmonizing and wordplay use are both on point. The first verse from Lil Wayne is mid, but it has a few good lines in it that showed me just how great Lil Wayne can be with wordplay. The second verse from 2 Chainz is mid as well, and unlike Lil Wayne\u2019s verse that has a bunch of vulgar stuff and a few good lines, this verse has a bunch of inoffensively mid stuff and a few vulgar lines. I\u2019m actually impressed with this song because it\u2019s not absolutely terrible as I expected it to be. It\u2019s just below mid, and that\u2019s a win for a strip club anthem.\u201cTransparency (feat. Usher)\u201d: After a bit of a rocky start, this album is finally starting to sound like a collab album between Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz, two of my all-time favorite rappers. This song is awesome. The chorus from Usher is mellow, laid-back, low-key, and has great lyrics and vocals, the first verse from 2 Chainz has a laid-back, low-key flow and great lyrics where 2 Chainz explores what he loves about his significant other and tells her everything he wants to do for her (this verse also includes one of 2 Chainz\u2019s signatures: A somewhat \u201cgoofy aah\u201d line that he blends very well into the rest of the verse, which is \u201cShe so thick, it\u2019s kinda hard to say skinny dip\u201d), and the second verse from Lil Wayne has a technical yet mellow flow and great lyrics where Lil Wayne gushes over his significant other and marvels at how well she can read him. The production from R&B hitmaker Hitmaka and the top 10 all-time GOAT producer MIKE DEAN is excellent, as MIKE DEAN\u2019s smooth and ethereal synths blend extremely well with Usher\u2019s melodic singing and Lil Wayne\u2019s auto-tuned crooning. Great track.\u201cSignificant Other (feat. Indyah)\u201d: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne are going on a heater right now! Two back-to-back 10s! This part of the album is like night and day from the first three tracks. This song has two parts, and unlike the immensely disappointing two-parter that was \u201cG6,\u201d this album\u2019s intro track, each part is absolutely dominated by 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne. The first part has a very lo-fi, laid-back, and low-key beat with a vocal sample that sounds like it could\u2019ve been taken from a soft rock song, Ted Ed piano chords, and subtle, almost nonexistent drums. 2 Chainz adopts a very mellow flow for this part of the song, but what he\u2019s discussing, which is the atrocities he faced growing up as a drug dealer in trap houses, is anything but mellow. The beat is almost foreboding at times, and 2 Chainz uses both the laid-back and foreboding elements excellently in his verse, where he paints vivid pictures of his life as a teenage drug dealer with great lyrics. The second part has a much more upbeat and fast-paced beat produced by 30 Roc that\u2019s kicked off by an amazing chorus from Indyah that has the same flow as Swae Lee\u2019s chorus from \u201cCalling (feat. A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, NAV & Swae Lee)\u201d by Metro Boomin. 30 Roc uses MIKE DEAN-style synths for the melody, and they sound great, fast-paced trap drums, and short, choppy chords. The verse from Lil Wayne has a fast and in-your-face flow that almost sounds as if Lil Wayne is in distress, which is a flow he\u2019s adopted many times before and mastered at this point. The lyrics on this verse are great, as they\u2019re almost a cry for help from Lil Wayne, as he\u2019s down on his luck and in need of love. Great song; if there\u2019s a third 10, I\u2019m gonna have to call this run a heater.\u201cP.P.A. (feat. Fabolous)\u201d: The production from Mark Byrd on this track is excellent; the soulful horns throughout the instrumental and the classic 70\u2019s R&B sample at the beginning of the song (I don\u2019t actually know who the sampled female vocalist at the beginning of the song is, but she sounds awesome and her voice goes extremely well with the soulful horns) are both brilliant. The subject matter of this song is pretty vulgar, as P.P.A. stands for \u201cpretty p**** award,\u201d but 2 Chainz\u2019s chorus is really the only thing that\u2019s not great on this song. 2 Chainz\u2019s first verse is great, as he\u2019s in a state of anticipation to meet up with a girl he likes and have sex with her, which he does a great job of being seductive and sultry with it instead of vulgar and disgusting. Lil Wayne\u2019s second verse is very good, but he doesn\u2019t do the seductive and sultry part of sex as well as 2 Chainz, and some of his lines are a bit too much and too far on the vulgar side. Fabolous has yet to give a bad feature verse from what I\u2019ve heard, and this song is just another very good feature verse from him, as he does a great job being seductive and sultry rather than vulgar on this verse. The only complaint I have is his slushie metaphor, which compares having sex and being inside a girl to red and blue slushies, which is pretty cringe, but that\u2019s really the only downside of the verse. Great track; it\u2019s not a 10, but this run still qualifies as a heater.\u201cShame\u201d: This album continues to deliver great songs and great surprises. A song with production from Havoc of Mobb Deep that includes 2 Chainz sampling the chorus from Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s \u201cShame On A *****\u201d and includes both 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne comparing themselves to Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Raekwon & Ghostface Killah in their respective verses? I certainly didn\u2019t expect it, but I absolutely loved it! Both verses from 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne were excellent, and the pseudo-spoken outro from Lil Wayne shows why 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne have excellent chemistry and should be making collab albums. The only small complaints that I have with this song is the two opening lines of Lil Wayne\u2019s verse and the chorus from 2 Chainz, where he adopts a somewhat weird-sounding deep vocal cadence. However, I eventually got used to it and it was pretty good. Great song, totally unexpected, but I love the homages to Wu-Tang Clan & Mobb Deep.\u201cGodzilla (feat. Vory)\u201d: The first verse from Vory is absolutely awesome; the laid-back, lo-fi synth-based production acts as an amazing compliment to Vory\u2019s smooth vocals and great lyrics. Vory\u2019s two choruses and verse are a great cool down from the last song, the energetic and hard-hitting \u201cBars,\u201d which was another song produced by Havoc of Mobb Deep in tandem with MIKE DEAN, where 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne both went hard, as they were \u201cshowing out for them Havoc beats,\u201d as 2 Chainz put it at the beginning of the song. Vory\u2019s first verse is amazing, but it\u2019s sort of an interlude to the main song, as after Vory\u2019s second chorus, 2 Chainz says \u201cOkay,\u201d and the beat switches while he launches into the second verse, a hard-hitting and braggadocious verse that shows Vory\u2019s verse was a cool down for him and Lil Wayne, but they\u2019re going in on this song just as hard as they went on the last song. 2 Chainz\u2019s verse was great, his chorus was good (albeit a bit repetitive and the vocal mixing was a bit grainy), and the two verses from Lil Wayne were both excellent. I\u2019ve gotta say, this album has been practically flawless in its back half; hopefully it makes it up there with the top projects of 2023.\u201cCan\u2019t Believe You (feat. Rick Ross & Tre\u2019Von Waters)\u201d: Great production from STREETRUNNER & Tarik Azzouz that includes an awesome piano melody, great saxophone breaks, and a great vocal sample melody; a good but repetitive chorus with very good vocals from Tre\u2019Von Waters; and a great feature verse from Rick Ross (whose collab album with Meek Mill dropped on the same day as this collab album); but 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne did not show up on here. 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne\u2019s ad-libs during the chorus and Lil Wayne\u2019s auto-tuned harmonizing on the outro were both great, but 2 Chainz\u2019s first verse was mid and Lil Wayne\u2019s third verse was entirely offbeat and terrible. I can\u2019t imagine Lil Wayne actually heard the beat before giving that verse because if he had, it definitely would not have sounded like that. That Lil Wayne verse was hard to listen to because he sounded like he was competing with the beat for space on the track. It sucks that 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne weren\u2019t great on this song because it had the potential to be the best track on the album, but unfortunately, it\u2019s mid.\u201cMoonlight (feat. Marsha Ambrosius)\u201d: Outstanding chorus with excellent vocals and evocative lyrics from Marsha Ambrosius. 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne both did well on this track, but Marsha Ambrosius on that chorus was probably the highlight. Either Marsha Ambrosius\u2019 chorus or Lil Wayne\u2019s second verse. She doesn\u2019t get nearly enough recognition, but Marsha Ambrosius usually does a great job when featured for choruses by hip-hop artists, as she\u2019s worked with 2 Chainz frequently (almost every time I\u2019ve heard her, it\u2019s been on a song with 2 Chainz), as well as Kanye West and Nas. The first verse from 2 Chainz is good, but his first few lines aren\u2019t great and he takes a minute to find his footing on this song. Lil Wayne\u2019s verse is absolutely excellent, though, and a perfect final rap verse for this album before Marsha Ambrosius caps off the song with a final chorus and great non-lyric vocals. Great way to end an album that got off to a very slow and rocky start.I hope the saying \u201cIt\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish\u201d is accurate enough that this album will be regarded as one of the best albums of 2023 because two of my all-time favorite rappers, 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne (the latter of whom has secured a spot in my top 10 all-time GOAT rappers list, and the former of whom has been battling for a permanent spot on that list for a while), had some awesome songs on this album. I\u2019m reluctant to say that this album is great or even good because of the first three songs on here: \u201cG6,\u201d \u201cBig Diamonds (feat. 21 Savage),\u201d and \u201cPresha.\u201d These tracks are so uncharacteristically trash and are such a poor representation of what this album has to offer that I wish they could just be thrown out. I was demoralized after hearing those first three songs, as 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne couldn\u2019t have gotten off to a worse start, especially considering that \u201cPresha,\u201d the album\u2019s worst song, was produced by Bangladesh, the man who produced Lil Wayne\u2019s classic banger \u201cA Milli,\u201d but after \u201cLong Story Short\u201d was good, the album didn\u2019t really have many downsides. I expected \u201cCrazy Thick\u201d to utterly suck, as 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne, despite being prolific with strip club anthems, often put out their worst songs when working in that genre, but it was actually not terrible. After that song, 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne knocked it out of the park every chance they got, firing on all cylinders with collaborations with singers like Usher, Indyah, and Marsha Ambrosius, as well as rappers like Fabolous and Benny The Butcher. Production greatly improved from that point on as well, as big names like top 10 all-time GOAT producer MIKE DEAN, Hitmaka, STREETRUNNER, and even Havoc of Mobb Deep stepped in and made some pretty awesome beats. Probably the most unfortunate bag fumble of the second half of the album was the Rick Ross & Tre\u2019Von Waters collab, where 2 Chainz\u2019s performance was mid and Lil Wayne couldn\u2019t seem to find the beat. 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne went in on epic verses on songs like \u201cSignificant Other (feat. Indyah)\u201d & \u201cOprah & Gayle (feat. Benny The Butcher),\u201d rapped circles around each other on the Havoc produced songs \u201cShame\u201d & \u201cBars,\u201d and showed their softer sides on songs like \u201cTransparency (feat. Usher)\u201d & \u201cP.P.A. (feat. Fabolous).\u201d I hope that the push made by 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne in this album\u2019s second half (and the tail end of the first half) is enough to make it good because I thoroughly enjoyed it and I believe they did a better job than Meek Mill & Rick Ross with their collab album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released November 10, 2023Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Trap, Dirty SouthTracks:SHAQ & KOBE \u2013 6.4Star Island \u2013 3.6Go To Hell (feat.

I\u2019ve always been a big fan of Rick Ross and he\u2019s always been in the conversation of my top 10 all-time favorite rappers, but Meek Mill is notoriously inconsistent and can either ruin a track or save it. I never know what I\u2019m gonna get when I listen to a Meek Mill song or a song on which he\u2019s featured. He can make an absolute banger like \u201cI\u2019m A Boss (feat. Rick Ross)\u201d or \u201cGoing Bad (feat. Drake)\u201d where he sounds like he\u2019s in his element and raps like he could be in that top 10 conversation, but he can also make an absolute embarrassment of a song like \u201cOoh Kill \u2018Em\u201d (his weak attempt at a Drake diss track) or \u201cNorthside Southside (feat. Giggs).\u201d On this song, Meek Mill gave an awful first verse and a chorus that was mid at best. Meek\u2019s lyrics on the first verse were bad, his flow and attempted flow-switch was garbage, and the vocal cadence he adopted when the beat cut off was stupidly cringe. Rick Ross\u2019 second verse was good, and I felt bad for him because he did a good job on this track (not one of his best verses, but a solid one nonetheless), but Meek Mill cringed it up. Instead of Shaq & Kobe, this song sounded like Brandon Miller & the rest of the scrubs on the Charlotte Hornets.\u201cStar Island\u201d: Wow, this song is absolutely garbage. I was expecting the beat to be mid after I heard the producer tag from ATL Jacob on here, but the beat is not the problem on this song. In fact, the production from ATL Jacob on this track has fast-paced trap drums along with a grandiose orchestral-sounding melody courtesy of its violin chords and piano arpeggios. It sounds like an upscale version of a Lil Durk or Meek Mill instrumental, which is exactly what this album should sound like, as Rick Ross loves to talk about opulence and wealth in his music and he is the upscale version of Lil Durk & Meek Mill in many ways. The first verse from Meek Mill is atrociously bad, as his lyrics are bad and make him sound like a conceited douchebag who is terrible to girls for no reason and flaunts his wealth in the dumbest ways possible, his flow is horrible and he can\u2019t make up his mind on what vocal cadence to use (which causes him to get offbeat multiple times), and his subject matter is bad as well. The second verse from Rick Ross begins with a co-sign by Rick of Meek\u2019s awful verse, as he says \u201cMeek Mill, I love it, man, I love it!\u201d after Meek just dropped one of the worst verses I\u2019ve ever heard from him, but it doesn\u2019t end there. Rick Ross proceeds to begin his verse totally offbeat, and when he eventually finds the beat, he doesn\u2019t hit his stride, but rather fumbles around with bad lyrics and a trash flow until the end of the song. Bad verses from both Meek Mill & Rick Ross on this song, terrible track.\u201cGo To Hell (feat. BEAM & Cool N Dre)\u201d: The production from Cool N Dre should\u2019ve been way better than it was. The song started with a sample from \u201cShout\u201d by Tears For Fears, which got me super hyped, partly because \u201cShout\u201d is a great song, but also because any Tears For Fears song is a cheat-code sample in any genre. However, the beat quickly switched off this sample and changed into a basic drum & 808 pattern that had the sound of \u201cperceived grandiosity,\u201d which is to say that Cool N Dre thought the drums & 808s on here sounded grandiose, but they ended up just sounding trite and contrived. The production then tried to utilize the Tears For Fears sample by splicing it throughout the song alongside the basic drum & 808 patterns and using parts of the melody that were hidden behind the overbearing drums & 808s. The first verse from Rick Ross was mid, as the lyrics weren\u2019t great and the subject matter showed Rick Ross going through the motions talking about opulence and wealth, but not really saying anything of value. It sucks because Rick Ross was supposed to be the guiding light for this album, but this verse was really a lowlight for him. The chorus from BEAM started out strong, but eventually, the flow got messed up by the mid production and BEAM didn\u2019t really say anything of value on the chorus despite having some good vocals (at least in the first part). The second verse from Meek Mill was mid, as the lyrics were mostly bad and there was an entire sequence dealing with Meek Mill having lunch with Tom Brady and relating to Tom Brady\u2019s life. He follows it up by saying \u201cI ain\u2019t never made it to the NFL, but hey, I\u2019m Meek Mill.\u201d It probably would\u2019ve been a good line if the rest of the verse hadn\u2019t had such bad lyrics. The third verse from Rick Ross was average, as he said some things on that verse that contributed value to the track and had some good lyrics, but ultimately, it was overshadowed by the mid production from Cool N Dre. What should\u2019ve been a great track with an awesome 80\u2019s New Wave sample turned out to be a total bust.\u201cDead Last (feat. Fabolous & Vory)\u201d: Finally! This song is what I expected from this album. The production from Kid Wond3r & TM88 centers around a beautiful piano melody and a subtle drum pattern, which is epic in and of itself and provides an awesome backdrop for the awesome verses and choruses on this song. The intro and first verse from Meek Mill are definitely his best performance so far on this album, as his flow is on point, his lyrics are great, and he doesn\u2019t try to do any ridiculous nonsense like flow-switching into a \u201cgoofy aah\u201d cadence or dropping out of pocket or \u201csus\u201d lines. Meek Mill\u2019s parts on this track are a perfect example of him reaching his full potential and going all-out on a track, as he raps about his struggle to get to where he is in his life now and how it was a longshot for him to make it, but he made it in spite of everything he had to overcome. The second verse from Rick Ross is amazing as well, with great lyrics and a great flow, and it can be summarized perfectly by the last two lines: \u201cI might\u2019ve let you beat me to a watch / But I\u2019d never let you beat me to the top.\u201d The third verse from Fabolous has some awesome lyrics and flows and is absolutely great, and it\u2019s definitely a sign that I need to review some of Fabolous\u2019 albums. I\u2019ve always liked what I\u2019ve heard from him on features, and this verse is no exception, as he raps about a similar subject to Meek Mill & Rick Ross, talking about his come up and how many people doubted him over the years. The chorus from Vory is amazingly well done, as his vocals are great, his lyrics are great, and the chorus is epic on its own in addition to being the perfect segue between the verses. Great song, I hope this track is a sign of good things to come.\u201cThey Don\u2019t Really Love You\u201d: An incredibly impressive performance from Meek Mill on this song! Meek Mill sings the chorus on this song, and he sings extremely well! He hits high notes, harmonizes, and sounds like a real singer on the chorus without much auto-tune used. I had to check the song credits to make sure that no one else was credited singing that chorus because it sounded nothing like him. Meek Mill sang the chorus while Rick Ross handled both of the verses on this song, and Meek did an excellent job with the singing on that chorus. I\u2019m surprised I hadn\u2019t heard anything like that before because it was amazingly well done. The first verse from Rick Ross was great, as he continued on the hot streak he started with the last song by giving some hard-hitting lyrics about how people show fake love in the industry and your fate can change on a dime in the music industry or in the streets selling dope. The second verse from Rick Ross was average at best, though, as he dropped some very out of pocket and quite questionable lines with a flow that was a bit too fast-paced for the beat. My least favorite line he dropped was where he mentioned killing the family of one of his opps, which was a bit too much and very out of pocket, especially considering the rest of the verse had nothing to do with it. Meek Mill stole the show on this song, though, an excellent singing performance from him on here.\u201cGrandiose (feat. Vory)\u201d: This song\u2019s title proves that one of this album\u2019s main themes is supposed to be the grandiosity, opulence, and fast-lane lifestyles of Meek Mill & Rick Ross, but unfortunately, the only thing grandiose about this song is Rick Ross\u2019 second verse. The production is disjointed and disorganized with an annoying melody and unsteady drum & 808 patterns, the chorus from Vory is mid at best, and the first verse from Meek Mill is complete and total garbage. Vory\u2019s vocals on the chorus are good, but his lyrics and flow are both mid at best, making the chorus not good. Meek Mill returns to his trash form on the first verse, as he attempts to switch his flow multiple times and cringes it up in the process and also drops bad line after bad line in a sequence of terrible lyrics. Rick Ross\u2019 second verse is very good, as his flow actually serves to anchor the disorganized beat and his lyrics are the only thing that give this song a sense of subject matter and structure. Rick Ross is in his element on this verse, rapping about wealth, opulence, and a grandiose lifestyle with money, women, and drugs, but neither Meek Mill nor Vory gave good performances on their parts and the production was bad.\u201cAbove The Law (feat. DJ Khaled & Teyana Taylor)\u201d: Over a classic G-funk Snoop Dogg sample, Rick Ross continues to outshine Meek Mill, even when Meek Mill gets two verses and Rick Ross only gets one. As much as I love DJ Khaled and his motivational quotes (and sometimes banger tracks), he was totally unnecessary on this track. The chorus from Teyana Taylor is mid, not because of her vocal performance, but because of the bad lyrics and bad flow. Her vocals are good, but the lyrics on that chorus were vapid and surface-level. \u201cI come alive in the night / Flashin\u2019 red and blue lights\u201d? I mean, come on, what does that even mean? Teyana Taylor does her best with the bad lyrics she\u2019s given, though. The first verse from Meek Mill is complete trash. He\u2019s fighting with the beat with his combative and overly fast flow, and his lyrics are mid as well. The second verse from Rick Ross was very good, as his good lyrics and flow yet again outshine Meek Mill and put Meek to shame. I guess that\u2019s why Meek Mill was given the third verse, to redeem himself after that embarrassing first verse. The third verse from Meek Mill is mid, but he does drop his only fire line of the song on the opening line of this verse: \u201cPolice tell me to freeze, I hold my wrist up.\u201d This song should\u2019ve been pretty good, but unfortunately, Meek Mill\u2019s trash performance and the bad lyrics on every part but Rick Ross\u2019 were enough to make it mid.\u201cFine Lines (feat. The-Dream & Wale)\u201d: On a laid-back, low-key, mellow heavy-reverb synth-based R&B fusion beat from The-Dream, Rick Ross & Wale prove that they\u2019re a better duo than Rick Ross & Meek Mill, as Meek Mill is notably absent from this song. The ethereal production from The-Dream is absolutely awesome, as it has a sound of 80\u2019s downtempo synthpop while also having a grandiose Rick Ross style to it. This song could\u2019ve easily been on Rick Ross\u2019 Port Of Miami 2 album. The first verse from Rick Ross is excellent, the second verse from Wale is great (which is insane because it seems like Wale only performs well when he\u2019s with Rick Ross; without him, Wale normally cringes it up and underperforms with wack lyrics and bad flows), and the third verse from Rick Ross is equally as excellent as the first. The chorus from The-Dream is amazing and has sultry, ethereal vocals that perfectly complement the instrumental and are very evocative. Great song all around; interestingly enough, the second 10 on this album came on a track without Meek Mill. Meek has a writing credit on this song, but no verse or production contribution.\u201cGold Medals (feat. Jeremih)\u201d: Slow, laid-back, lo-fi production from Bongo & Hitmaka, a good chorus from Jeremih that sets the tone for this track very well, and verses from Meek Mill & Rick Ross where they discuss their romantic exploits and move away from the discussions of money, drugs, and different women every night. It\u2019s a nice change of pace for this album, especially after Rick Ross just used a very similar beat to drop two verses that sounded like the gold-flaked champagne of rap verses (which is pretty much where he\u2019s in his element; rapping about money and expensive things). The chorus from Jeremih is good, and for the first time in a few tracks, Meek Mill drops a verse that\u2019s average. His flow isn\u2019t bad on this song, but it\u2019s not that good either. His lyrics are really the saving grace of this first verse. The second verse from Rick Ross is very good, but the third verse from him, which has some very vulgar and pretty disgusting sexual references in it, was average at best, although he managed to salvage it in part by attempting to romanticize the vulgar things he dropped on that verse. The clapping at the end of the song during Jeremih\u2019s final chorus was also not great, but overall, this song is good.\u201cLyrical Eazy\u201d: Short (only a minute and 40 seconds), sweet, and gets the job done. Meek Mill\u2019s first verse on this song was probably his best verse on the entire album, as he was rapping with the same level of intensity that he\u2019s rapped with on some of his hardest and best songs (the flow on this song really reminded me of \u201cDreams And Nightmares (Intro),\u201d which is one of his most popular songs and a staple for hype playlists). His references to imprisoned rappers 42 Dugg & Young Thug both went hard, and his hard-hitting flow and great lyrics made this verse one to remember for Meek Mill. He even outdid Rick Ross on this song, which is a first for him on this album and probably in his entire career. Rick Ross\u2019 second verse on this song was good, but a few out of pocket and \u201csus\u201d lines dropped it from being great, and Meek Mill really stole the show on this song anyway. Great track.\u201cPillow Talk\u201d: Meek Mill outshines Rick Ross again on an energetic Tay Keith beat with fast-paced drums and a fired-up, upbeat melody. The first verse from Meek Mill on this song was very good, as he rapped with intensity, drive, and determination, which was reflected in great lyrics and a good flow. The chorus from Meek Mill was good, but a bit repetitive and could\u2019ve been more nuanced. The second verse from Rick Ross was good at best, as he started off with the same flow he normally uses, which wasn\u2019t a good flow to use for this energetic and upbeat Memphis rage beat (albeit Tay Keith\u2019s Memphis rage sound was toned down a bit on this beat). It took Rick Ross a few lines to find his footing on this beat, but once he did, he rapped well with good lyrics and a solid flow. It seems like Rick Ross & Meek Mill are really pulling through in the latter half of the album. I\u2019ll be interested to see if more good songs come out of this second half surge.\u201cIn Luv With The Money (feat. Future)\u201d: Back to back tracks without Meek Mill having a verse? Weird for an album that\u2019s supposed to be a collab album between Rick Ross & Meek Mill, but truthfully, I would much rather hear Rick Ross than Meek Mill, and the main reason I wanted to review this album was to hear Rick Ross rather than Meek Mill. It seems that Future had no good features to give to anyone dropping November 10, 2023, as his chorus on this song and verse on Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cThat\u2019s On You (feat. Future)\u201d from Chris\u2019 underwhelming album 11:11 were both absolute garbage. The chorus on this song was ridiculously repetitive, had terrible vocals, and Future completely phoned it in. The two verses from Rick Ross on this song were average at best, as he wasn\u2019t at his best either on this song, but Future completely cringed it up with that garbage chorus. I wish Meek Mill had been on here to sing the chorus instead of Future; judging from \u201cThey Don\u2019t Really Love You,\u201d he would\u2019ve done a much better job.\u201cSHAQ & KOBE (Remix) (feat. Damian Lillard & Shaquille O\u2019Neal)\u201d: Since Meek Mill & Rick Ross\u2019 verses and chorus are the exact same on this song as they are on the original version, I\u2019ll only be talking about the two NBA players featured on this song. The second verse is delivered by Milwaukee Bucks and long-time Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard, and though he had a few \u201csus\u201d and out of pocket lines on his verse, he actually bodied Meek Mill since Meek\u2019s verse was so garbage on this track. The fact is, Damian Lillard can rap, so he has a career if he ever wants it after he leaves the NBA. His verse was average overall, but he had a few really good lines that demonstrated his understanding of wordplay and lyricism. He\u2019s better than a lot of rappers who are out right now, which is insane to think about, as he\u2019s a dominant NBA player who also bodied Meek Mill on this track. He drew level with Rick Ross in terms of flow and lyricism, though. Speaking of drawing level with Rick Ross, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, better known as Shaq, did the fourth verse on this track and sounded like Rick Ross if he smoked three packs a day. Shaq had a rap career in the 90\u2019s which he has revitalized a few times throughout the 21st century when he thinks it\u2019s appropriate, but in the 90\u2019s, he was collabing with the likes of Michael Jackson & The Notorious B.I.G., so he was no joke. \u201cRollin\u2019 through Philly, they treat me like Meek / They treat me like I\u2019m Ricky when I\u2019m on the beach\u201d was probably the best line Shaq delivered on his verse, or perhaps \u201cDid a song with Biggie, it was all a dream.\u201d Either way, Shaq isn\u2019t letting people forget how big of a deal he was in the music industry, and how big of a deal he still is in modern pop culture. The verse is overall mid, however, as Shaq\u2019s flow is a downgraded version of Rick Ross\u2019 and most of his lyrics are trivial and bad. This song also didn\u2019t need to be 7 minutes long; it really exacerbated the flaws of the track.November of 2023 was a big month for hip-hop. Meek Mill & Rick Ross dropped a collab album on November 10, and 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne followed them only a week later with their Welcome 2 Collegrove collab album on November 17 (which will be reviewed immediately after this album). Now, 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne are both great artists who have impeccable chemistry when they link up and have multiple great albums by themselves, but Meek Mill & Rick Ross can\u2019t necessarily say the same thing. Rick Ross has multiple great albums by himself, but I don\u2019t know if Meek Mill has a single great album, and they don\u2019t always do well when they\u2019re together. Their most hard-hitting and well-known collab was \u201cI\u2019m A Boss (feat. Rick Ross)\u201d back in 2013, which is a smash hit and essential for any hype or gym playlist, but shouldn\u2019t that collab have prompted this album to be released in 2013 rather than 2023? Meek Mill & Rick Ross aren\u2019t necessarily as associated nowadays as they were when Meek was getting his start and Rick was his mentor. Nevertheless, this album came out, and pretty much what I thought would happen happened. Meek Mill is notoriously inconsistent in his music, and Rick Ross is much more consistent and doesn\u2019t miss quite as often. That\u2019s not to say he doesn\u2019t have a few bad songs and albums, but he\u2019s achieved cheat-code feature status and the Port Of Miami albums are outstanding. What I thought would happen was that Rick Ross would perform well for the most part and Meek Mill would not, which would lead to a bunch of mid or bad songs. That\u2019s pretty much how this album went down. Rick Ross had some mid and bad verses on this album, don\u2019t get me wrong, but Meek Mill\u2019s good moments were few and far between. When both Meek Mill & Rick Ross showed up on a track, great songs like \u201cDead Last (feat. Fabolous & Vory),\u201d \u201cThey Don\u2019t Really Love You,\u201d and \u201cLyrical Eazy\u201d happened, but when Rick Ross showed up and Meek Mill didn\u2019t, mid songs like \u201cMillion Dollar Trap,\u201d \u201cAbove The Law (feat. DJ Khaled & Teyana Taylor),\u201d and \u201cIconic\u201d happened. When neither one of them showed up, complete trash songs like \u201cStar Island\u201d & \u201c800 Karats\u201d served to tank the overall rating of this album. There were a few featured artists who really stood out on this album by having great performances, such as Vory, The-Dream, Jeremih, Fabolous, and Wale, but they were the only featured artists who made impactful contributions that really helped Meek Mill & Rick Ross. Overall, the main takeaway from this album is that Rick Ross had to carry most of it, but whenever Rick Ross did well and Meek Mill showed up and performed at his full potential, hits were made.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released November 10, 2023Genres: Rhythm & Blues (R&B)/Soul, Pop, Pop Rap, Trap, Afrobeat, DancehallTracks:Angel Numbers / Ten Toes \u2013 9.8Sensational (feat.

The first part, \u201cAngel Numbers,\u201d is a little over a minute and a half and is structured like one of Chris Brown\u2019s amazing interludes. Chris Brown is to interludes what Drake is to intro tracks; both artists do a lot of things well, but they rarely ever miss on their interludes / intro tracks. This part is a mellow, laid-back, and lo-fi track with an acoustic guitar melody and lush synth chords. I wasn\u2019t sure about this section at first because the acoustic guitar melody had an indie rock sound to it and the lyrics sounded like some \u201cgoofy aah\u201d \u201cheal your chakras\u201d crap, but the more I listened to it, the more I liked it. Chris Brown\u2019s vocals are silky smooth and absolutely on point, the lyrics are about moving on and healing from a bad relationship, the harmonizing is ethereal and amazing, and lines like \u201cI gotta move on somehow\u201d and \u201cHealing energy / I need it / When it\u2019s 11:11, I need it\u201d are not only awesome lyrics delivered with great harmonies, but also set up the rest of the song and the rest of the album. This part is an excellent start to the song. The second part, \u201cTen Toes,\u201d is a four minute song where Chris Brown sings and raps on a beat that\u2019s similar to the first beat with its acoustic guitar melody, piano flourishes, and lush synth chords, but different with its trap drum pattern courtesy of Hitmaka, who blends the two sounds brilliantly. Chris Brown\u2019s chorus of \u201cAnxiety / Don\u2019t let it get to your head / You know we play for keeps / Don\u2019t let it go over your head\u201d lets everyone know that he\u2019s not letting negativity affect him and he\u2019s re-establishing himself with this album. This chorus is both motivational and establishes a few themes for this album: Combating anxieties, revitalization, and healing from past trauma. The two verses in this part are both very good, as Chris blends singing with rapping brilliantly and even drops a reference to DJ Khaled\u2019s GOD DID album in his first verse. There are a couple of bad lines that sound like contrived and trite rap bars, but for the most part, the lyrics are very good. I\u2019ve gotta say, this track is a very promising start for Chris Brown with this album.\u201cSensational (feat. Davido & Lojay)\u201d: Normally, Chris Brown does well when he does Afrobeat, but this song is pretty bad. The production is good, especially with its subtle saxophone melody paired with lush synth chords, but Chris Brown\u2019s performance could\u2019ve been way better. His chorus is mid, his first verse is good at best, and his second verse is mid. The third verse from Davido is good at best; it\u2019s far from his best verse on a collab with Chris Brown, and the fourth verse from Lojay is straight up bad. The lyrics on that fourth verse are laughably cringe and his vocals sound like a prepubescent version of Davido. Chris Brown\u2019s other Davido collaborations \u201cLower Body (feat. Davido)\u201d and \u201cNobody Has To Know (feat. Davido)\u201d are way better than this song. This track is one of Chris Brown\u2019s worst attempts at Afrobeat.\u201cBest Ever (feat. Maeta)\u201d: Absolutely amazing song! Chris Brown always has exceptional chemistry with female pop & R&B singers when he collabs with them, and this song is another great example of that chemistry. The production from Sad Money, who has worked extensively with downtempo R&B singer Sabrina Claudio (not to be confused with Sabrina Carpenter) and featured artist Maeta as well, employs downtempo synth bass chords, subtle and relaxed drums, and a fleeting and simple synth melody, which creates the perfect laid-back & lo-fi beat for this song. The first verse and chorus from Maeta are both incredible; I recently discovered she released an album in 2023 that had features from James Fauntleroy, Ty Dolla $ign, and a few other notables, so I might have to check that out after her outstanding performance on this song. Her smooth, sultry, and seductive vocals were perfect for this beat and set up the narrative of intimacy between her female character and Chris Brown\u2019s male character impeccably. Chris Brown\u2019s second verse and joint chorus with Maeta were equally incredible; his use of harmonies and different vocal cadences on his verse perfectly displayed his anticipation and nerves about being intimate with the female character on this song. I\u2019m gonna have to hear more from Maeta after this amazing performance on this great song.\u201cNo One Else (feat. Fridayy)\u201d: Disappointing, mid, and nowhere near as good as Fridayy & Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Give It Away\u201d from Fridayy\u2019s 2023 self-titled debut album. The production on this track includes a bland acoustic guitar melody, Afrobeat drums, and chords that sloppily fill the space between the Afrobeat drums and lazy acoustic guitar strums. The joint chorus from Fridayy & Chris Brown where they express their need to be around a girl and jealousy when she\u2019s not there is good, and while these two great vocalists harmonize well on there, Fridayy\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t featured as prominently as they should be. Fridayy sounds like an afterthought on this song. The two verses and bridge from Chris Brown are all mid; his lyrics are bland and flavorless and his vocals aren\u2019t anything special. If the Maeta collaboration hadn\u2019t been so stellar, this song would be a massive disappointment, but since Chris Brown\u2019s Maeta collab scored a 10 on the previous track, I\u2019m ok with this song being mid.\u201cShooter\u201d: Absolutely horrendous attempt at Afrobeat by Chris Brown with this song. The bridge is the only part of the song that\u2019s mildly good, and the main reason for that is because Chris Brown is singing in his normal voice and attempting to sing well instead of using the various garbage vocal cadences he adopts on this song. Chris sings the chorus in a stupid, cringy, high-pitched vocal cadence that makes him sound ridiculous. Chris\u2019 two verses include a bad flow that adopts English with a Nigerian dialect, bad lyrics, and mid vocals. The production on this song is nothing special, as the drum pattern is a basic Afrobeat drum pattern and the melody is mostly driven by a subtle vocal sample and a few shouting vocal samples spliced throughout. This song is absolutely garbage, as Chris Brown normally does pretty well with Afrobeat and collaboration with Afrobeat artists, but this song was absolutely horrible.\u201cMidnight Freak\u201d: A very subtle and very well-used sample of Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cLove More (with Nicki Minaj)\u201d in the melody of this song is one of the best aspects of this song\u2019s production. The production on this song from Bizness Boi, Elliott Trent, and Chris Brown himself is pretty good and shows flashes of brilliance in its drum pattern and impressive sample use, but unfortunately, Chris can\u2019t capitalize on the good production. The first verse is average and Chris shows slivers of how great he can be with some suave, smooth, and sultry R&B vocals, but the chorus is mid at best and the second verse is mid. Ultimately, bad lines, disinterested vocals, and reliance on the vocal and lyrical strength of the first verse coupled with the sample of Chris Brown\u2019s classic track \u201cLove More (with Nicki Minaj)\u201d led to this song being mid.\u201cBouncing / G5\u201d: The first part of this song is Chris Brown\u2019s attempt at an R&B-style \u201cstrip club anthem,\u201d which doesn\u2019t work for pretty much all hip-hop artists and doesn\u2019t work at all for him with this track. The production is listless, flavorless, and uninspired, as the drums are generic, the melody is bland, and Chris Brown\u2019s generic strip club anthem lyrics absolutely do nothing for it. The second part of this song starts out promising with an ethereal beat driven by downtempo synth chords and a subtle drum pattern that somewhat resembles the fast-paced drums from Clipse\u2019s \u201cGrindin\u2019 (feat. Pharrell Williams),\u201d but unfortunately, the promising production is quickly derailed by a trash verse with bad lyrics from Chris Brown. After starting the second part off with a few bad lines, Chris Brown only gets worse and cringes it up for the rest of the verse. Chris Brown would\u2019ve been in his element on both of these beats if he wasn\u2019t trying to conform to stupid gimmicks, but he unfortunately wastes both of them in an effort to jump on trends and do something different with his music. Not the right kind of experimentation on this song.\u201cSummer Too Hot\u201d: A pretty good song after a long drought of good songs and a ton of mid and bad tracks that showed a complete lack of effort from Chris Brown. Pretty much everything from \u201cBest Ever (feat. Maeta)\u201d until this song was either complete and total filler with no effort or just plain bad due to trash experimentation in the genres of EDM, dancehall, and Afrobeat from Chris Brown. The bouncy production from DSTRK and RoccStar strikes a nice balance between sultry R&B and club banger pop rap with its hollow snare drums, fast-paced hi-hats, and consistent 808s. The first verse was good, as the flow was great, the vocals were good, and the lyrics were average; the second verse was good at best, as the flow remained great, but the vocals and lyrics took a dip in quality from average to mid; and the chorus was average at best, as Chris Brown had a few great moments with vocals and harmonies, but the lyrics were bland, generic, and lifeless for the most part. The song\u2019s concept is very muddied and doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but because Chris Brown turns on the charm and finally has some good flows and vocals on what has been a dormant album for him, it\u2019s a pretty good track.Underwhelming, lackluster, and despite being shorter than each of Chris Brown\u2019s three previous albums Heartbreak On A Full Moon (2017), Indigo (2019), and Breezy (2022), too long. Chris Brown kicked this album off extremely well with the motivational banger \u201cAngel Numbers / Ten Toes\u201d that not only hit on the album\u2019s central concepts but also brilliantly exhibited his skill sets for singing, rapping, and harmonizing, but it was pretty much downhill from there. The best song on the album was \u201cBest Ever (feat. Maeta),\u201d where Chris had excellent chemistry with female R&B singer Maeta, who is quite stylistically similar to Sabrina Claudio, and sang brilliantly to complement her and the downtempo production, but that track and the intro were flash in the pan moments of brilliance from an album where Chris Brown displayed very little. The Future collab was abysmally bad, as both Future & Chris Brown had terrible rap verses with bad lyrics over mid production. The Fridayy collab barely featured Fridayy, as his vocals were an afterthought on the chorus and Chris Brown gave mid performances on the verses. Chris Brown attempted various genres on this album, including Afrobeat, dancehall, and EDM, but he\u2019s done all of these genres better on other albums. The Afrobeat and dancehall offerings on this album, including \u201cSensational (feat. Davido & Lojay),\u201d \u201cNo One Else (feat. Fridayy),\u201d \u201cShooter,\u201d \u201cNightmares (feat. Byron Messia),\u201d and \u201cMessed Up,\u201d were all terrible displays and examples of botched experimentation. What frustrates me is that Chris Brown has had success in both of these genres before, but on this album, he seemed totally outside his element. The main failed EDM experiment on this album was \u201cVery Special,\u201d which showed Chris trying a bargain-brand version of Jersey Club that had a terrible instrumental and only remotely resembled what a Jersey Club beat should sound like. A very disappointing effort from Chris Brown rife with apathetic filler tracks, mid beats and shotty production from Diego Ave, RoccStar, and Elliott Trent on a bunch of songs, and Chris failing to deliver performances above mid on songs where he should\u2019ve been in his element.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released December 6, 2023Genres: Pop, Synthpop, Art Pop, Rhythm & Blues (R&B)/SoulTracks:Crying In The Carwash \u2013 9.4How To Love \u2013 7Ice Cube \u2013 6.8Lava Lamp \u2013 7.3Encore \u2013 7.9Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cCrying In The Carwash\u201d: \u201cCrying in the carwash, tryna feel something in a city that never rains,\u201d Lolo Zoua\u00ef confesses wistfully on the chorus of this song. This song takes a little while to get going, but once the pre-chorus starts and the drum pattern picks up, Lolo Zoua\u00ef hits her stride and the song becomes epic. The intro chorus and first verse are both average, but the pre-chorus, chorus, and post-chorus are all absolutely awesome. The second verse is almost an extension of the chorus in some ways, but Lolo\u2019s evocative vocals on that verse really separate it and make it stand out, even though it\u2019s between a post-chorus and pre-chorus that are two of the best parts of the song. This song has a really creative concept, as Lolo compares her feelings to a carwash in a city where it never rains and her tears to the water in the carwash. Everyone around her is happy, but she can\u2019t join them in their happiness (\u201cDon\u2019t invite me, I\u2019ll be boring / I\u2019m not in the mood to party\u201d really exemplifies this paradigm). The melancholy lyrics are juxtaposed well with the fast-paced drum pattern and light piano melody that make the song sound somewhat like a club or synthpop banger. This track is definitely better than most of what Lolo Zoua\u00ef showed on PLAYGIRL, so I hope this track is a sign of good things to come. Great intro.\u201cHow To Love\u201d: I really hoped this song would be a cover of or would sample Lil Wayne\u2019s Tha Carter IV classic song \u201cHow To Love,\u201d but unfortunately, this song is incredibly mid. The vocals and vocal distortion from Lolo Zoua\u00ef on this song are both pitchy and off-key, and her lyrics, which beg her significant other to \u201cteach her how to love,\u201d are narcissistic and conceited. Definitely not a good track from Lolo Zoua\u00ef; she should\u2019ve gone with the Lil Wayne cover instead of this mid crap.The title track \u201cCrying In The Carwash\u201d is great, but other than that, there isn\u2019t anything that special about this short 5-track album. Lolo Zoua\u00ef starts the album with more synthpop influenced songs and slowly transitions more into R&B as the album progresses, but she does a good job blending the two styles with mellow production and smooth vocals on this album. Lolo\u2019s lyrics are extremely toxic and conceited on this album for the most part, with the exception of the title track \u201cCrying In The Carwash,\u201d where she expresses vulnerability for the only time on the album, which makes the smooth and sultry songs difficult to listen to, as Lolo expresses desires to cheat on her boyfriends and act up so her boyfriends leave her on multiple different occasions throughout this album. I was hoping that maybe \u201cHow To Love\u201d would be a Lil Wayne cover, but it was unfortunately just a mid song with no nuance. I hope \u201cCrying In The Carwash\u201d ends up on one of Lolo Zoua\u00ef\u2019s regular albums, but as for the rest of the tracks, they\u2019re forgettable and don\u2019t make an impact.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released December 1, 2023Genres: Emo, Pop, Art PopTracks:Lethal Woman \u2013 0.6Still \u2013 0.8Breakfast \u2013 0.1Sand \u2013 5.4White Glove \u2013 0.4God\u2019s Game \u2013 0.3Boyfriend \u2013 0.8FRAGILE THINGS \u2013 0.1Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cLethal Woman\u201d: What did I just listen to? This song is extremely weird. The production is a mix between earrape level industrial drums that sound like Kanye West\u2019s \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d (and most of his 2013 experimental industrial album Yeezus) if it was mixed poorly and turned up to earrape volume, operatic and orchestral backing vocals that give the song a gaudy and overblown sound, and a piano melody that makes the track sound like it\u2019s supposed to be a score for a horror movie. The production on this song is horrendously bad, and Dove Cameron\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t much better. The vocal mixing on this song is about as earrape in volume as the industrial drums are, and Dove Cameron is made to sound like the lead vocalist in a garbage death metal band with the mixing of the vocals. The lyrics on this song make absolutely no sense, as Dove Cameron throws out some \u201cgoofy aah\u201d \u201chorror movie aah\u201d vocals, then follows it up with \u201c\u2018Cause game recognizes game.\u201d What are we even doing here? I thought this song might go the route of sampling \u201cEvil Woman\u201d by Electric Light Orchestra considering the title, but I knew it was a long shot, and based on how this song sounds, I don\u2019t want Dove Cameron anywhere near an ELO sample.\u201cBreakfast\u201d: It seems like all of the songs I\u2019ve heard so far on this album have been engineered to be 5-second snippets on poorly made TikTok edits. It also seems like all of these songs are cheap, watered-down, bargain-brand imitations of other pop artists\u2019 music. Dove Cameron has, so far, blatantly copied the vocal styles of Billie Eilish, Tate McRae, and Olivia Rodrigo, but I don\u2019t think any of them care because she\u2019s doing such a bad job of imitating them that they would never be able to tell. This song\u2019s quotable sound bite: \u201cOoh, so you wanna talk about power?\u201d It\u2019s painfully obvious that these songs are the most watered-down, basic, bland, cheap, and generic attempts at replicating the 2023 emo pop that\u2019s currently trending on TikTok. Dove Cameron is making some of the worst music I\u2019ve ever heard just so she can get a few seconds of airplay on a bad TikTok edit. It\u2019s absolutely horrific. The lyrics, vocals, and production on this song completely suck. This album sounds like Olivia Rodrigo if she was even more melodramatic and emo than she already is.\u201cSand\u201d: Okay, this song is still bad, but at the very least, Dove Cameron is trending in the right direction. The pre-chorus bridge actually sounds like a normal pop song and actually shows off Dove Cameron\u2019s vocals and her vocal talent. She\u2019s not an incredible vocalist, but she\u2019s good enough that she should be making music that\u2019s better than what I\u2019ve been hearing on this album so far. I\u2019m glad her vocals were finally showed off on that pre-chorus that was actually pretty good. The production on this song was industrial sounding and extremely weird yet again, but it was not in-your-face and boisterous like it was on the intro track. Earrape drums, weird electronic clash noises, and way too much vocal distortion on Dove Cameron\u2019s voice, especially on the chorus, were all problems on this song, but these things were less of a problem on this song than they\u2019ve been on other tracks, so that\u2019s progress. The verses on this song were abysmally awful, though, as Dove Cameron talked in whispered spoken word on the verses in some nihilistic emo psychobabble that no one could understand. However, the pre-chorus on here showed promise, and I only hope Dove Cameron can get her act together and do more stuff like that later on this album.There has been a lot of bad music to come out of 2023. This year has seen the fall-offs of Aly & AJ, Rae Sremmurd, Jack Harlow, and Juicy J, while Trippie Redd, Lil Pump, and Coi Leray continued their campaigns of irrelevancy. This year has seen career-low performances for Drake, Sabrina Carpenter, and Lil Wayne in the three albums they dropped, and it has seen Drake take a myriad of L\u2019s: starting with co-signing Teezo Touchdown\u2019s debut album and ending with him dropping a Scary Hours deluxe edition of his career worst album For All The Dogs that proceeded to rank as his second worst album of all time. Olivia Rodrigo somehow managed to do worse with her second album than with her first, and Ken Carson dropped a new album that was praised for absolutely no reason at all. Good music has been few and far between this year, with Ava Max holding the AOTY title with an 8.4 album from January until July, when Travis Scott\u2019s masterclass album UTOPIA took the title. There have been a lot of bad albums in 2023, but I think Dove Cameron seriously made a case for having the worst album of 2023 with this abysmal excuse for music. This album combines the lyrics of an emo pop singer who exploits mental health issues for profit, the horrendous singing of Olivia Rodrigo, the apathy of Ken Carson, and the songwriting of every TikTok artist who makes one awful song to get their 15 minutes of fame and then dips off the face of the Earth. On every track on this album, Dove Cameron painfully struggles to put together anything that makes a remote bit of sense with her lyrics and song structure while mimicking the vocals of emo pop contemporaries Olivia Rodrigo, Tate McRae, and GAYLE. The production on this album is all over the place and demonstrates a complete musical ineptitude (essentially, someone came into the studio, turned all of the knobs on the equalizer all the way up, and said, \u201cit sounds better this way\u201d), and the songwriting is painful to listen to. Dove Cameron doesn\u2019t know what she wants to talk about on this album, and it\u2019s painfully obvious, as she throws out emo metaphors and similes that make no sense and tries to force one-liner TikTok quotables at the most random times in her songs. The pre-chorus on \u201cSand\u201d is the only thing on this album that shows Dove Cameron\u2019s potential as a singer. I really enjoyed her in the Disney Channel movie franchise Descendants, and her singing was pretty good in those movies, but since the death of her close friend Cameron Boyce, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s changed irreversibly. It\u2019s incredibly sad to watch, as this awful music is not the only thing that she\u2019s done that screams a cry for help. I seriously hope she gets the help she needs to assist her in grieving this tremendous loss. These nihilistic lyrics prove that she\u2019s not okay and has been going through it for some time, so I believe she should stop trying to make useless TikTok songs to make more money and step away from the public eye for a time. It\u2019s painfully obvious that there\u2019s no real substance here and it\u2019s just an attempt to make a quick buck through the TikTok algorithm. Dove Cameron, it\u2019s time to hang it up and get some help.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released November 17, 2023Genres: Pop, Elegant Pop, Disco, ChristmasTracks:A Nonsense Christmas \u2013 3.4buy me presents \u2013 6.2santa doesn\u2019t know you like i do \u2013 10cindy lou who \u2013 7.5is it new years yet? \u2013 9.6white xmas \u2013 7.6Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cA Nonsense Christmas\u201d: \u201cNonsense\u201d: A great song from Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s 2022 album emails i can\u2019t send that was a 10. The track was very suggestive with many sexual innuendos and great sultry, seductive vocals from Sabrina Carpenter that showed her infatuated and crushing hard on a man.

Each time Sabrina Carpenter has attempted to remix \u201cNonsense,\u201d first with the Coi Leray feature and now with this Christmas-themed version that mixes jingling bells into the original instrumental, it\u2019s been garbage. Just leave the song alone. This song is totally not it at all. The Christmas-themed sexual innuendos are straight up cringe, and not even Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s sexy, seductive voice can make them sound good. They\u2019re just pure and unfiltered cringe, the worst of which probably being either \u201cI\u2019m talkin\u2019 big snowballs,\u201d \u201cI need that Charles Dickens,\u201d or \u201cBoy, that package is to big to gift wrap.\u201d I know Sabrina Carpenter has done Christmas music before and has succeeded with it, but why would she think a remix of \u201cNonsense\u201d with a \u201cgoofy aah\u201d jingle bells instrumental with Christmas sexual innuendos would actually work? This song now takes the spot away from \u201cskinny dipping\u201d as Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s worst track. In back to back months, my two favorite artists Drake & Sabrina Carpenter have dropped the worst songs in their discographies. Unbelievable.\u201cbuy me presents\u201d: Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s A+ vocals, the saxophone solo, and the sampled drum bridge from Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d exercise a HARD carry on this song. Everything else about this track is egregiously trash. The cringe Christmas-themed sexual innuendos from the first track carry over into this one, and they\u2019re even more vulgar on this track. The second verse even shows Sabrina Carpenter lusting after Santa Claus, and it\u2019s absolutely cringe. Sabrina absolutely knocks it out of the park with vocals on this track, and the saxophone solo hits extremely hard, but nothing else about this track besides the drums that were sampled from MJ\u2019s classic banger \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d is remotely good.\u201csanta doesn\u2019t know you like i do\u201d: That\u2019s how you do it. Sabrina Carpenter just bounced back in the best way she possibly could. She stuck to her guns by making a sultry, seductive, and sexy banger that mixes downtempo elegant pop with upbeat pop and adapted it to Christmas by putting holiday-themed references in the song. The track\u2019s warm, lush production gives a Christmas song feeling (it sort of resembles Wham!\u2019s \u201cLast Christmas\u201d), and Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s vocals have the same warm, calming, lush sound to them. Yet another example of why she\u2019s a top 5 GOAT female vocalist. The spoken outro that leads into the final chorus is the solidifying example that Sabrina Carpenter knows how to make a Christmas-themed banger. This song is awesome and will likely enter my regular rotation of Christmas songs.\u201ccindy lou who\u201d: The synth solo after the second chorus was absolutely awesome and sounded like something I would hear from MIKE DEAN or on Drake\u2019s Take Care album. The production on this song was very well done, but this track is essentially the Christmas-themed version of \u201copposite\u201d or \u201chow many things\u201d from Sabrina\u2019s emails i can\u2019t send album: A depressing, melancholy, slow breakup song where Sabrina reminisces about her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend. The title references the girl who her ex-boyfriend is now dating, as Sabrina doesn\u2019t know her name, so she likens her to the Grinch character played by Gossip Girl\u2019s Taylor Momsen in the egregiously cringe live action version of the Grinch with Jim Carrey. Mid song.\u201cis it new years yet?\u201d: A disco banger for crying at the Christmas party. This song is absolutely awesome! The disco production and Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s great vocals and flows on this track make me wonder why she hasn\u2019t tried to do more disco before. This song is sort of like a sad, holiday-themed version of Dua Lipa\u2019s Barbie movie banger \u201cDance The Night,\u201d but even this track has some strengths that song doesn\u2019t have. Both have a great disco sound to them, but this track incorporates a few Christmas sounds in the instrumental, and Sabrina Carpenter makes the pre-chorus and chorus hit so much harder than Dua Lipa does on \u201cDance The Night.\u201d The emphatic and nuanced vocal delivery Sabrina Carpenter offers on the pre-chorus and chorus makes those two things the best part of the song, and while Sabrina Carpenter offers some angsty and pessimistic sentiments on the verses, her great vocals and amazing chorus really cancel those out for the most part. Absolute banger that came out of nowhere.\u201cwhite xmas\u201d: Sabrina overdoes it with this Christmas music classic. Of course, I\u2019m used to hearing this song from the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s vocal jazz crooners like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby rather than from one of my favorite pop singers of all time, but still, Sabrina\u2019s breathy vocal delivery and constant switching between styles on this song is just too much and makes the track lack cohesion. If she had gone the straight and direct route: picking a style and sticking to it, this song could\u2019ve been a great cover, but ultimately, it\u2019s just a misguided attempt at covering a Christmas classic.Sabrina Carpenter has done Christmas music before, but she\u2019s never released a whole album of Christmas songs. It\u2019s common for Disney Channel pop singers to release Christmas songs as a part of holiday compilations or holiday albums under the Disney Channel, as Miley Cyrus (Hannah Montana), Selena Gomez, and Aly & AJ all did that while they were signed to the Disney Channel label. This album would definitely not be suited for the Disney Channel, though, I can tell you that much. Despite the holiday theme of this album, it is probably Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s most vulgar music I\u2019ve ever heard. However, the vulgarity of this album really only results in pure and unfiltered cringe. The two opening songs \u201cA Nonsense Christmas\u201d and \u201cbuy me presents\u201d both contain a myriad of Christmas-themed sexual innuendos that are absolutely ridiculous. \u201cI might change your contact to Has A Big North Pole,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m talkin\u2019 big snowballs,\u201d \u201cI need that Charles Dickens,\u201d and \u201cBoy, that package is to big to gift wrap\u201d are some of the most heinous examples. They\u2019re laughably funny but also extremely cringe. Sabrina fortunately abandons that framework and moves on to make some amazing original tracks in \u201csanta doesn\u2019t know you like i do\u201d and \u201cis it new years yet?,\u201d which will both be definitely going in my Christmas music rotation, as they\u2019re great songs. Unfortunately, Sabrina botches her cover of \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d with \u201cwhite xmas,\u201d but it\u2019s only mid and not bad. Overall, the main takeaways from this album are that Sabrina Carpenter needs to do more disco music and stop making remixes of \u201cNonsense.\u201d", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 28, 2018Genres: Pop Rock, Synthpop, Pop, Indie (Singer-Songwriter)Tracks:Strangers Again \u2013 7.5The Fuss \u2013 7.4I Like The Way \u2013 9.5Personal \u2013 7.5Voices \u2013 6.4Scream \u2013 8.5Almost Forgot \u2013 6.4P.A.T.T. \u2013 4.2Friendly Reminder \u2013 6.8Come Alive \u2013 7.2Sweet Surrender \u2013 10Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cI Like The Way\u201d: A tasteful and intriguing blend of synthpop and pop rock. The first two songs on this album were very mid pop rock songs that offered little to no nuance, but this song shows that Against The Current knows what they\u2019re doing with integrating their pop rock sound into synthpop. Will Ferri, drummer and keyboardist for Against The Current, is the real MVP of this song, as he blends a lush and upbeat synth melody with pop rock drums that integrates the two sounds very well together. The production is excellent on this song thanks to Will Ferri. Chrissy Costanza, lead singer of Against The Current (no relation to Seinfeld\u2019s George Costanza), gives her best vocal performance and best lyrics so far on the album with this song. Chrissy Costanza is a pop rock band vocalist, and her somewhat harsh and middle-range vocals are tailor made for the pop rock genre. However, on this song, her vocals are softer, the synth melody complements her voice very well, and her lyrics and vocal delivery are both happier than they\u2019ve been so far on the album. Chrissy Costanza\u2019s vocal performance on this song reminds me of Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cPermanent December\u201d from her 2010 album Can\u2019t Be Tamed, which is another song that blends synthpop and pop rock (emphasis on the synthpop for that song, though). The lyrics detail a blossoming relationship where Chrissy Costanza admits everything she likes about her significant other and encourages both of them not to think about the future, but to live in the moment. The two verses are great and the chorus is very good, but the bridge is a bit lackluster and it sounds like a pop rock band trying to do synthpop. Great song overall, I hope to hear more tracks like this one.\u201cScream\u201d: A laid-back and low-key synthpop song that juxtaposes a mellow and relaxed synth melody from Will Ferri and vocals from Chrissy Costanza that are probably her best on the album so far with lyrics about a contentious relationship where both sides are constantly fighting with each other. Chrissy Costanza\u2019s vocals on this song are great. Her light and airy vocal delivery and the high pitch of her vocals (she employs a range on here that\u2019s much higher than she usually uses) makes her sound more like a pop singer than a pop rock singer on this track. She sounds kind of like Ava Max or Sabrina Carpenter on this song, which leads to a more convincing synthpop song. The lyrics offer an interesting contrast to the mellow and lo-fi sound created by Chrissy Costanza\u2019s vocals and Will Ferri\u2019s synths on this song, as Chrissy Costanza is singing about a dysfunctional relationship where both people push each other to the brink but always come back because of their twisted and manipulative love. Honestly, the relaxed sound was necessary to keep this track from sounding hopeless and depressing. Chrissy Costanza\u2019s verses are good and her chorus is pretty good as well, and the production from Will Ferri shows that he can do synthpop just as well as he can do synthpop / pop rock fusion. Good song, definitely a refreshing break from the mid streak that had been going on.\u201cFriendly Reminder\u201d: I like the uplifting message of this song; Chrissy Costanza\u2019s chorus where she gives herself \u201cA friendly reminder / Remember to smile / Remember the pain only lasts for a while\u201d is good conceptually and I love the lyrics, but the production and vocals on this track are both very generic, cookie-cutter, unoriginal, and indicative of Disney Channel bubblegum pop. This song sounds like a rejected demo for Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 album (as Chrissy Costanza sounds sort of like Taylor Swift on this track and tries to mimic the vocal delivery Taylor has on tracks like \u201cStyle\u201d and \u201cShake It Off\u201d) or a rejected demo from a Hannah Montana or early Miley Cyrus album. The song\u2019s subject matter is great, but it doesn\u2019t exactly help the song\u2019s case for not being a Disney Channel bubblegum pop track. The bland guitar riffs from guitarist Dan Gow; the Taylor Swift style vocals from Chrissy Costanza, and the contrived pop rock production all combine to make this song sound like a poorly executed Disney Channel pop rock song.\u201cSweet Surrender\u201d: Wow. What a great track and a powerful way to end an album. I don\u2019t often talk about songs being good outros because it\u2019s hard to make a song that ends an album well, especially if the album is really good and you don\u2019t want it to end, but this song is a great outro. This album didn\u2019t deserve such a triumphant outro since it was relatively mid overall, but it actually works in this song\u2019s favor because it\u2019s that much more of a standout now. The mellow, lo-fi, laid-back synth melody with arpeggios from Will Ferri reminds me a lot of \u201cLabyrinth\u201d by Taylor Swift while also being unique and indicative of Will Ferri\u2019s ability to do synthpop well. The vocals from Chrissy Costanza are amazing on this song; the vulnerability and emotion she expresses in her vocals and lyrics on this track is absolutely awesome. Her lyrics deal with being vulnerable in a relationship and opening up to someone, and her vocals are on point the entire time throughout this track. Will Ferri also applies some reverb and synth effects to her vocals, which make them sound somewhat similar to Lady Gaga\u2019s vocals, specifically on her banger hit \u201cPaparazzi.\u201d This song is a great synthpop ballad and an excellent conclusion to an overall mid album.For those who are unaware (like I was before doing this review), Against The Current is a pop rock band from Poughkeepsie, New York, and follows the power trio format with vocalist Chrissy Costanza, guitarist Dan Gow, and drummer / multi-instrumentalist Will Ferri. They\u2019re signed to Fueled By Ramen, the same record label as twenty one pilots, and their style is somewhat similar to twenty one pilots, as both bands take influence from pop, pop rock, and some punk and synthpop. Their styles are both mostly pop rock, but they attempt various fusions of the four genres across their albums. With this album, Against The Current leaned heavily into synthpop, relying on Will Ferri to blend their usual pop rock style with synth melodies. Will Ferri\u2019s production is definitely a highlight of this album. Whenever he\u2019s relegated to drums, he\u2019s mid at best and doesn\u2019t make an impact on vapid and basic pop rock songs, but when he\u2019s on the keyboard and making synth melodies, he shines. \u201cI Like The Way,\u201d \u201cScream,\u201d and \u201cSweet Surrender\u201d are the only good tracks on this album, and it\u2019s mostly because of Will Ferri\u2019s excellent production. He fuses pop rock and synthpop successfully on \u201cI Like The Way\u201d and creates mellow and lo-fi synth melodies on \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cSweet Surrender\u201d that are perfect for those songs. Guitarist Dan Gow is irrelevant on this album, as his guitar parts are indicative of listless and lifeless pop rock that sound like even more bland and flavorless versions of Weezer guitar riffs. At least Weezer\u2019s guitar riffs are somewhat catchy and can be good from time to time, but Dan Gow\u2019s sound like stuff from rejected twenty one pilots demos. Chrissy Costanza doesn\u2019t exactly shine as a vocalist on this album, but she has some good moments. Too many times throughout this album, Chrissy Costanza sounds like a generic and basic pop rock female vocalist. She doesn\u2019t attempt to differentiate herself from other groups doing the same genre and other artists using the same vocal style on most of this album\u2019s mid tracks. Lyrics are extremely sporadic on here as well; as they can either be really good or painstakingly mid with no nuance whatsoever. When Chrissy Costanza decides to break out of this pop rock mold, though, she\u2019s at her best, as synthpop songs like \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cSweet Surrender\u201d show how great her vocals can be outside of mid pop rock. Unfortunately, the great vocal moments from her on this album are few and far between, as the majority of this album sounds bland and banal. A few highlights, but not enough to put Against The Current on my radar.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released November 17, 2023Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop RapTracks:Red Button \u2013 5.4Stories About My Brother \u2013 8.2The Shoe Fits \u2013 2Wick Man \u2013 2.4Evil Ways (feat. J. Cole) \u2013 7.2You Broke My Heart (feat. Smiley) \u2013 4.6Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cRed Button\u201d: There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s wrong with this song. Firstly, this track sounds like it\u2019s supposed to be a Drake outro track where he raps on a beat with a vocal sample with a single verse, but it falls extremely short of being comparable with any of Drake\u2019s outro tracks where he raps a single verse on a beat that contains a vocal sample from pop or R&B. Secondly, this song is a Kanye West diss track that takes very thinly veiled shots at Kanye West that touch on his erratic and often controversial behavior, his refusal to go on medication for his mental issues, and his constant calling of truces between he & Drake only to go back on them later. The Kanye disses on this song were extremely unnecessary and weird, as Kanye has pretty much already destroyed his career with his anti-Semitic behavior and Alex Jones interview in December of 2022. As a Jewish person, I\u2019m sure Drake was hurt by Kanye\u2019s comments, especially considering how he and Kanye had a truce going when he made the comments, but dissing Kanye West in November of 2023 when he hasn\u2019t dropped any music in a year and a half and hasn\u2019t been relevant for almost a year? Oddly timed and petty on the part of Drake. Thirdly, the production on this song from Ovrkast. and Lil Yachty is garbage. The operatic vocal sample is overpowering and not conducive to rapping on whatsoever; it\u2019s yet another example of why Lil Yachty needs to stop producing for Drake. He made several of the atrocious rage beats on For All The Dogs, and now that he\u2019s tried his hand at a \u201cDrake outro type beat,\u201d he proves even more that he sucks as a producer. Fourthly, the lyrics just aren\u2019t good. Drake\u2019s similes and metaphors are mid at best and his lyrics on this track just show malaise and apathy. His line about Taylor Swift being the only person he\u2019s ever moved his release date for was fire, but everything else was not good. The fact that a song like this is landing in the bottom half of all Drake songs really proves that Drake needs to take some time away from music and reevaluate.\u201cStories About My Brother\u201d: Good production from Conductor Williams (who also produced \u201c8AM In Charlotte\u201d from the regular For All The Dogs album) and Jimmy Q on this song, but the trumpet chords can get a bit annoying after a while. Both verses from Drake on this song are good, but the interlude and outro are a bit cringe because Drake uses a high-pitched voice to say \u201cBut enough about me.\u201d Each verse has a lot of good lines and a few bad ones, but neither show an extreme amount of consistency from Drake. Drake dropped some very good lines on this song like \u201cIt\u2019s like he playin\u2019 EDM, he a chain smoker,\u201d \u201cYou do your shootin\u2019 on the web, you Spider-Man / My brother robbin\u2019 it down to you junes like Iron Man,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s him, me, and a white ting, we movin\u2019 like Paramore,\u201d but he also dropped some bad lines on here like \u201cMy brother a tool toter, my brother a tombstoner\u201d and \u201cBoy, I\u2019m on top of the cake just like some caramel sauce.\u201d It\u2019s hit and miss for Drake with good and bad lines across these verses, but overall, this song is pretty good and better than pretty much everything on For All The Dogs. There may be hope for this deluxe edition yet.\u201cEvil Ways (feat. J. Cole)\u201d: Production from Vinylz, Boi-1da, and FNZ which centers around a pitched-up sample from The Family Circle\u2019s song \u201cChange\u201d is incredibly mid, as the attempt at a pitched-up soul sample beat is horribly executed. The drums are weak, the backing melody for the sample is bad, and the sample itself gets annoying after only a few repetitions. The back-and-forth rapping between Drake & J. Cole on a single verse doesn\u2019t work on this song, as each artist will drop a few mid lines and one or two good ones before the other one takes over. Neither artist sounds like they want to be on this song, as they\u2019re both going through the motions with their flows and lyrics on here. The lyrics are mostly mid and the flows are as well. Although Drake & J. Cole teaming up is cool and their collaboration from the regular For All The Dogs album \u201cFirst Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole)\u201d was good, this song sounds like a mid throwaway.\u201cYou Broke My Heart (feat. Smiley)\u201d: Vinylz & FNZ did a great job with the production on this song, as the triumphant horn-heavy instrumental with hard-hitting drums sounds similar to Drake\u2019s non-album single \u201cLaugh Now Cry Later (feat. Lil Durk).\u201d However, the production is the best part of this song. Drake brought out his singing voice to sing \u201cyou broke my heart\u201d a few times on here, and it was undoubtedly some of the best vocals he\u2019s given on this album and the entirety of the regular For All The Dogs album, but that was a flash in the pan. The first verse from Drake was good, but the second verse, which featured ad-libs from cringy and garbage OVO Sound rapper Smiley, was mid, and the song got progressively worse after that. The third verse, which featured Drake singing, was bad and had some uncharacteristically bad vocals from him, and the bridge that it transitioned into was overly repetitive, stupidly dramatic, and just plain filler. This song was an example of Drake trying to merge too many of his styles into one song: Aggressive rapping, melodic rapping, singing, discussing his past relationships, and discussing his position in the rap game. The result was a track that summed up For All The Dogs and this Scary Hours deluxe edition pretty well: Inconsistent and disjointed.A deluxe edition that is a representative snapshot of the larger album for which it is the deluxe edition. For All The Dogs is one of the most disappointing and spectacularly awful albums of all time. For All The Dogs is one of the most disappointing and spectacularly awful albums of all time. It is a stain on Drake\u2019s otherwise pretty great legacy (with the exception of Honestly, Nevermind, the errant misfire of an album in 2022), and for all intents and purposes, it should be buried and erased from his discography. However, instead of letting For All The Dogs live out its time on the charts with the few good songs it had ruling them (i.e. \u201cFirst Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole),\u201d \u201cIDGAF (feat. Yeat),\u201d and \u201c8AM In Charlotte\u201d), Drake decided to dial up another edition of his Scary Hours EP series with six new tracks to go along with For All The Dogs. The first two Scary Hours EPs gave us classic Drake songs like \u201cGod\u2019s Plan,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Next,\u201d \u201cWants And Needs (feat. Lil Baby),\u201d and \u201cLemon Pepper Freestyle (feat. Rick Ross),\u201d but I\u2019ll be hard pressed to remember any songs from this album. Production was sporadic and mostly terrible on this album, the lyrics and flows were lazy, phoned-in, contrived, bland, basic, and banal, and Drake\u2019s subject matter varied from extremely petty to non-existent. This album proves Drake needs to take a year or two off from music before returning to it, as he has to take the L, realize his mistakes, and come back stronger from it. At the very least, this album was entirely hip-hop and played to Drake\u2019s strengths rather than dabbling in rage rap or other genres Drake should not be getting into. Overall, this album might not be as bad as For All The Dogs, but it\u2019s pretty representative of how that 23-track atrocity sounded.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released December 7, 2018Genres: Trap, Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop Rap, Dirty SouthTracks:Off The Boat \u2013 0.4By Myself \u2013 1.4BiPolar (feat.

Quavo)\u201d: The first of three Quavo features on this album, and this song is a near miss where Gucci Mane was hard carried by Quavo and the production from Deko, OG Parker, and Smash David. The production from Deko, OG Parker & Smash David is great on this song, as they create an atmospheric trap beat with a solid drum pattern and deep, foreboding synth chords that are especially prevalent on the pre-chorus breaks. The production is awesome and it\u2019s a perfect beat for Quavo, as his harmonizing and ad-libs with great auto-tune use blend beautifully with the beat. Quavo\u2019s auto-tune use on his ad-libs, especially on the chorus and on Gucci Mane\u2019s verse, is probably the best part of the song. The chorus from Gucci Mane is mid at best, as Quavo\u2019s ad-libs carry him and his lyrics are mid. Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse is mid at best, as the lyrics are bad, the flows are lazy, and Quavo\u2019s ad-libs carry hard. Lines like \u201cA marijuana war, we\u2019ll take your trees like Scrooge\u201d (when Gucci Mane is referencing the Grinch instead of Scrooge here), \u201cIce Cream Mane, man, I pull up in a tank\u201d (I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about here), and \u201cI feel like Mamma Mia \u2018cause I\u2019m whippin\u2019 in the sink\u201d (has nothing to do with the Mamma Mia movie or ABBA) show that Gucci Mane doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s rapping about and that his similes and metaphors are all falling short. Quavo\u2019s second verse is average at best, as he starts out strong, but his verse is ultimately not very good because of stagnant flows and mid lyrics. Unfortunately, a near miss for Gucci Mane & Quavo.\u201cFather\u2019s Day\u201d: Over a shockingly and uncharacteristically bad Metro Boomin beat, Gucci Mane laments that he doesn\u2019t get enough recognition for being the father of trap music. He basically says that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get nothin\u2019 for father\u2019s day\u201d although all of the current rappers in the trap subgenre are his sons and should be thanking him for being the first to do it. The fact of the matter is, though, this song sucks and is completely awful despite having a top 10 all-time GOAT producer and potentially the greatest producer in the history of trap music on the beat. This beat is probably one of the worst ones I\u2019ve heard from Metro Boomin, but Gucci Mane certainly doesn\u2019t do it any favors with his absolutely horrible rapping on here.\u201cLost Y'all Mind (feat. Quavo)\u201d: Spiffy Global produced one of the most \u201cgoofy aah\u201d beats of all time on this song! What is that synth melody? I can\u2019t believe Gucci Mane heard this beat and said \u201cyeah, this sounds like a banger, I want this beat on my album, and let\u2019s put Quavo on there too.\u201d Unbelievable. The two verses from Gucci Mane on this song are both garbage, and the chorus from Quavo sounds robotic, disingenuous, choppy, and as if Quavo doesn\u2019t want to be on this song. I can\u2019t say I blame him with the horrible production on here, though. The second of three Quavo features on this album is an unequivocal L.\u201cWake Up In The Sky (with Bruno Mars & Kodak Black)\u201d: A Bruno Mars feature was exactly what this album needed to get it going! Bruno Mars, who sang the very good chorus on this song and produced it in tandem with DY Krazy, did an amazing job with this track. Bruno Mars doesn\u2019t often drop music or do features, but he almost always makes an impact when he does, and he was able to elevate Gucci Mane & Kodak Black in the process. The chorus from Bruno Mars was very good, and Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse was good at best, but it had a few great lines on it. \u201cI got white girls blushin\u2019, homie, college girls rushin\u2019 on me,\u201d \u201cGucci Barry White, I\u2019m singin\u2019 to your ho,\u201d and \u201cA one man show, a human bankroll\u201d delivered in a smooth and laid-back delivery alongside an amazing, soulful instrumental make Gucci Mane sound like a smooth operator ladies man and help to back up the \u201cI\u2019m him\u201d claims he\u2019s made on this album. Kodak Black\u2019s verse was incredibly mid, as Kodak is anything but smooth or sultry, and his attempts to be don\u2019t work whatsoever. Even alongside Bruno Mars and a soulful instrumental, Kodak Black can\u2019t be anything more than mid, especially when he tries to sing. I\u2019m glad Gucci Mane tapped Bruno Mars for this song because it was better than anything else he\u2019s done so far on this album. However, it was still a near miss.\u201cSolitaire (feat. Lil Yachty & Migos)\u201d: A clever play on words in the title and on the chorus linking solitaire diamonds to the solitaire card game to celebrate Gucci Mane\u2019s release from prison. The production from DJ Durel, Quavo, TheLabCook, and Honorable C.N.O.T.E. is average at best, as the Atari-style synth melody and sporadic yet solid trap drum pattern is a bit too much. The beat seems perfectly tailored to Quavo & Takeoff, the Migos members featured on the song, but neither Gucci Mane nor Lil Yachty can seem to find a groove on it. The chorus from Gucci Mane is mid at best, as it\u2019s overly repetitive and beats the solitaire play on words to death. The first two verses from Takeoff & Quavo are both very good, but they\u2019re too short and Migos can\u2019t really make a huge impact on the song. The Lil Yachty third verse is longer than both Takeoff\u2019s & Quavo\u2019s respective verses, and his verse is terrible. The Gucci Mane fourth verse that follows Yachty\u2019s garbage display is average at best, as he gives a few good lines, but it\u2019s ultimately not enough for a good verse. Between the Atari synth melody, the short Migos verses, the overly repetitive Gucci Mane chorus, and the trash Lil Yachty verse, this song is mid.\u201cMad Russian (feat. Lil Skies)\u201d: Great production from CuBeatz & Murda Beatz, which includes a pop vocal sample, a strong trap drum pattern, and a mellow 808 bassline. However, although Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse is good, the rest of the song sucks, including Gucci Mane\u2019s chorus, which is delivered in the laziest and most monotone way possible. The second verse from Lil Skies is absolutely trash because Lil Skies\u2019 auto-tuned vocal delivery and whiny flow is absolutely horrible. There\u2019s a reason this guy was only popular for 2018 and part of 2019, and it\u2019s because his voice is incredibly annoying and his lyrics are basic, bland, and ridiculous. His voice is so incredibly annoying and dumb that it makes it next to impossible to concentrate on what he\u2019s saying, though. His refrain between his verse and Gucci Mane\u2019s chorus (and also after the chorus) is trash as well. This song wouldn\u2019t be too bad if it was a solo Gucci Mane track, but with the Lil Skies feature, it\u2019s absolutely garbage.\u201cMoney Callin\u201d: After producing one of the most \u201cgoofy aah\u201d beats of all time for \u201cLost Y'all Mind (feat. Quavo),\u201d Spiffy Global redeems himself with a spacey, psychedelic, dark synth beat that sounds absolutely awesome in its mellow and spacey glory. Unfortunately, Gucci Mane\u2019s two verses on this song are mid and his chorus is bad because it\u2019s overly repetitive and lyrically vapid. Gucci Mane talks about how money is calling him and how he likes \u201cpretty, sassy women,\u201d but other than that, there\u2019s not too much else going on with this song. The production is undoubtedly the best part of the song.Either worse than or on the same level as Gucci Mane\u2019s 2019 album Delusions Of Grandeur. This album absolutely sucks! Gucci Mane had one song that scored an 8, the top possible mid score, on Delusions Of Grandeur, which was his Rick Ross & Wiz Khalifa collaboration \u201cLame (feat. Rick Ross & Wiz Khalifa),\u201d and on this album, he also had one song that scored an 8: \u201cWake Up In The Sky (with Bruno Mars & Kodak Black),\u201d which is one of his most successful songs ever and this album\u2019s biggest hit. Both albums had no songs that were above an 8. On this album, Gucci Mane is flawed in every way he can be. His flows are lazy, half-baked, uninspired, and show him going through the motions; his lyrics are bad, dumb, stupid, and show a lack of comprehension of what he\u2019s rapping about; and his subject matter is either non-existent, not well-defined, or dumb. Gucci Mane gets carried by features whenever the featured artists perform well, but when they don\u2019t, the song is that much worse. Gucci Mane featured Quavo three times on this album: \u201cBiPolar (feat. Quavo),\u201d \u201cLost Y'all Mind (feat. Quavo),\u201d and \u201cSolitaire (feat. Migos & Lil Yachty),\u201d and all three times were misses. Quavo did his best work when he teamed up with Takeoff and was featured as a part of Migos on \u201cSolitaire (feat. Migos & Lil Yachty),\u201d and other than that song, he was only slightly better than Gucci Mane. The production on this album was extraordinarily hit and miss, as some songs (even from the same producer) had great beats and others had the \u201cgoofiest aah\u201d beats of all time. Spiffy Global\u2019s track record on this album was the perfect example, as he produced one of the worst beats ever on \u201cLost Y'all Mind (feat. Quavo),\u201d but probably the second best beat on the album with \u201cMoney Callin.\u201d \u201cWake Up In The Sky (with Bruno Mars & Kodak Black)\u201d was this album\u2019s crown jewel and greatest achievement, as Bruno Mars was the best feature on the album, the beat was the best beat on the album, and Gucci Mane had his best verse on the album with that song. It\u2019s fitting that the song blew up in the way it did because it\u2019s definitely the best thing Gucci Mane was capable of doing in 2018. If only Kodak Black had not been featured on the song, it might\u2019ve actually been good. Overall, this album is absolutely terrible and shows how bad Gucci Mane used to be. It\u2019s interesting to hear this album after listening to Gucci Mane\u2019s 2023 album Breath Of Fresh Air because it sounds like two completely different artists.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released October 17, 2023Genres: Trap, Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop Rap, Dirty SouthTracks:Must Be Me \u2013 8.7Bluffin (feat.

I can\u2019t believe that Gucci Mane, at 43 years old and on his hundred-and-somethingth album, is still continuing to improve. Although J. White Did It is not a great producer, which he\u2019s showcased consistently by producing trash trap beats for Gucci Mane, Megan Thee Stallion, and Iggy Azalea over the years, this beat is very good. The instrumental samples an Ed Townsend song (who is a 70\u2019s R&B, soul, and jazz singer), and the vocal sample, trumpet licks, and trap drums blend together very well. Gucci Mane gives two good verses on this song that have a few bad lines but are overall good. The chorus from Gucci Mane ties the song together well, especially considering how he shouts out his record label 1017 Records and how influential he\u2019s been at influencing the genre of trap. Gucci Mane\u2019s two good verses are a testament to his longevity, his ability to transition from drug dealer to multi-millionaire music mogul, and his commitment to his family. Nobody else can do the things Gucci Mane has done according to him, so it must be him. That\u2019s the general gist of this song. It\u2019s the first time Gucci Mane has made an \u201cI\u2019m him\u201d claim on one of his albums and I actually believe him. Very good intro track; probably the best one of any Gucci Mane album I\u2019ve heard.\u201cBluffin (feat. Lil Baby & Indyah)\u201d: Production from Kuttabeatz, LMC, ProdBySquare, and Indyah (a singer who is also featured for additional vocals on this track) is excellent on this song. The vocals from Indyah are absolutely beautiful and completely ethereal, and they\u2019re delivered in a form that makes them sound like a vocal sample. The violin chords, well-executed and brilliantly arranged trap drums, and violin melody on this song are all incredible for this beat. The first verse from Lil Baby might sound offbeat on first listen, but he\u2019s rapping in such a nuanced flow that he raps with the melody instead of the drums. Lil Baby continues his hot streak for features in 2023 with this amazing verse, which has great lyrics, a nuanced flow that actually goes really hard and offers him more room to work than if he had taken the conditional approach, and great auto-tune use. The second verse from Gucci Mane is just as good as Lil Baby\u2019s as he rises to Lil Baby\u2019s level as opposed to getting bodied by him. He uses the same unconventional flow and has great lyrics on top of it. Gucci Mane has now gone 2-0 on his opening tracks for this album, with the latter track being a 10. I\u2019ve gotta say, the performance Lil Baby & Indyah give on this song is reminiscent of Lil Baby & Suzanna Son on The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cFalse Idols (feat. Lil Baby & Suzanna Son).\u201d\u201cInternet Chatter\u201d: Started off strong, as Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse was average, but the second verse and the chorus are extremely goofy and straight up cringe. The production from Murda Beatz on this song is mid, as it\u2019s as basic as trap beats come and there is very little nuance applied. However, I thought Gucci Mane would take this beat and do something with it considering how strong he started off, as he was focused on flexing his own status while putting down those on the Internet who don\u2019t want to see him winning, but eventually, Gucci Mane started trying to sing on the chorus and gave some supremely goofy lines that sounded ridiculous and cringe.\u201cTalkin To The Streets (feat. Mac Critter)\u201d: Production from Mike WiLL Made-It & Zaytoven is absolutely fire on this song! The bell synth melody mixed with hard-hitting trap drums and ethereal synth chords is an amazing arrangement, and it shows the brilliant blend of Mike WiLL Made-It & Zaytoven\u2019s trap production styles. Zaytoven is definitely the better producer (based on consistency and level of experimentation in his beats), but Mike WiLL can\u2019t be counted out, as he comes through with bangers from time to time, and this song is definitely a banger. Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse is absolutely awesome; one of his best verses on this album and perhaps one of his best verses of all time. I\u2019ve gotta say, Gucci Mane is showing up and making his presence felt on this album more than he ever has on his previous albums, and his commitment to good lyrics and good flows has made him a force to be reckoned with. The verse shows Gucci Mane discussing his current wealth status as well as talking about his time in the streets, and it transitions directly into Mac Critter\u2019s verse. During Mac Critter\u2019s second verse, things fall apart a bit, as most of his lines are not great and his aggressive delivery often overshadows the greatness of this instrumental and he doesn\u2019t use the beat to its full potential. His verse has a few good lines, but it\u2019s overall too long and the bad lines overshadow the good ones most of the time. If not for the great production and the awesome Gucci Mane verse, Mac Critter\u2019s mid performance would be a lot more impactful.\u201cKing Snipe (with Kodak Black)\u201d: The production from Richie Souf is uncharacteristically mid on this song, and Kodak Black dominates the track with two verses and a chorus despite it being on Gucci Mane\u2019s album. The first verse from Kodak Black is horrendously awful, as the lyrics are completely trash, the flow is offbeat, and Kodak uses his signature nasally, whiny, and grainy vocal delivery on it. The first verse transitions into Kodak Black\u2019s chorus, which is almost as bad as the verse but slightly better because of a few lines that aren\u2019t completely awful. The second verse from Gucci Mane is good, but the mid production quality from Richie Souf and Kodak Black\u2019s choruses that surround it really take away from how good the verse is. Gucci Mane really is taking initiative to have good lyrics and good flows on this album, but on this song, his good verse wasn\u2019t nearly enough to prevent this song from being terrible. The third verse from Kodak Black was mid and better than the first one because he chose to use auto-tune and rap melodically rather than using his normal stupidly bad nasally vocal delivery on it. The lyrics weren\u2019t good on that verse either, but the auto-tuned flow made it more bearable. Overall, terrible song, which I\u2019d expect from a Gucci Mane & Kodak Black collab.\u201c06 Gucci (feat. DaBaby & 21 Savage)\u201d: Terrible production from Ambeeza & Nik Dean, a horrible chorus from DaBaby, a worse first verse from DaBaby, and mid verses from Gucci Mane & 21 Savage. DaBaby sucks so much! The fall-off he experienced was completely justified, as he only managed to get worse after everyone discovered that his entire style was based on a single flow he developed rapping on jetsonmade and Pooh Beatz basic trap beats. Even Pooh Beatz has evolved since producing DaBaby\u2019s breakout hit song \u201cSuge,\u201d but jetsonmade hasn\u2019t really evolved, and DaBaby has regressed to rapping on terrible beats with a worse flow than he ever had on his albums Baby On Baby or KIRK (or even his flop of an album BLAME IT ON BABY, for that matter). The first verse from DaBaby on this song is so bad, as he starts out with some trash lyrics and an offbeat flow, but then the beat is cut off and DaBaby starts rapping in a pseudo-spoken slam-poetry type flow that just sounds horrific. His verse ends shortly after that egregious production choice, leading into the chorus that is almost as bad and bland as the verse. Gucci Mane has the best verse on the song with his second verse, but his verse starts out slow and only has a few good lines. 21 Savage got the short end of the stick on this song, as his verse started out trash and didn\u2019t get much better, but his flow was solid and if this beat had been better, the verse might have finished stronger than it did. I can\u2019t believe Gucci Mane thought it was a good idea to feature DaBaby on this song because he completely sucked on here!\u201cPissy (feat. Nardo Wick & Roddy Ricch)\u201d: Wow, this album is a revitalization and rejuvenation of more than one career, as this feature from Roddy Ricch is probably his best work since before his 2021 flop album LIVE LIFE FAST made him into a mid rapper where every feature he did was either mid or bad. Roddy Ricch had a pretty good performance on DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cFAM GOOD, WE GOOD (feat. Gunna & Roddy Ricch)\u201d from Khaled\u2019s 2022 album GOD DID, but even then he was outperformed by Gunna. On this song, Roddy Ricch took control with an awesome chorus and never relinquished control. His first verse was great, as his flow was hard-hitting and serious, his lyrics were great, and the subject matter revolved around his past as a drug dealer, his wealth, and sports references (specifically the New Orleans Pelicans, which Gucci Mane also references in his second verse). It was a perfect verse for Roddy Ricch, and that chorus was excellent as well. Gucci Mane continues to go on a hot streak with his second verse, as he\u2019s been solid throughout this album with only a few really bad performances and a couple of mid ones, but mostly good verses where he\u2019s putting everything he has into his lyricism and re-establishing himself as the guy he\u2019s wanted everyone to believe he is for the past decade: The inventor of trap music. The thing that ruined the song and made it mid was Nardo Wick\u2019s verse. Nardo Wick has never been a good rapper, but this verse completely threw off the timing, flow, and rhythm this song had going. His verse included a bunch of trash lines, a bad flow, and bad lyrics overall, although there were two lines where I had to step back and say, \u201cOkay, that was actually pretty good.\u201d Nardo Wick\u2019s lines \u201cWhat Gucci say? Well damn\u201d (followed by a Gucci Mane ad-lib of \u201cwell, damn\u201d) and \u201cShe say her wishes to me, \u2018cause she know I\u2019m a shooting star\u201d were actually pretty fire, but overall, his verse sucked. Solid product on this track as well. It would\u2019ve been good if someone other than Nardo Wick had done the third verse; I suspect 21 Savage would\u2019ve done well on this song.\u201cMarried With Millions\u201d: Another one of Gucci Mane\u2019s best solo songs of all time, if not his absolute best solo song. This song beats out the intro track \u201cMust Be Me\u201d by a single point, but that single point was hard-earned by this song. The production from TP808, which includes a subtle, airy, and soft piano melody alongside a smooth and downtempo trap drum pattern, is excellent on this song, and Gucci Mane takes advantage of it. The chorus is good, but it\u2019s a bit repetitive and some of the lines could\u2019ve been better. Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse is definitely the highlight of the song, though, as it\u2019s a great verse where Gucci Mane talks about all the hardships he endured over the course of his long career as a rapper. Gucci Mane discusses people who pretended to be his friends then took the stand against him in court, discusses being wrongly accused for certain crimes, and discusses how he\u2019s committed to keeping his circle small in this verse. It goes along with the theme of this album, which is Gucci Mane returning to the celebrity status he so often flaunts in his music with songs that actually back up the claims he\u2019s been making. The second verse is good but not great, as it mostly deals with Gucci Mane demanding the release of his friends who were locked up over the course of his career. Another very good song from Gucci Mane and a nice play on the sitcom Married With Children starring Ed O\u2019Neill with the title of the song.\u201cWoppenheimer\u201d: It seems as though Gucci Mane is determined to continue breaking his own records with his first ever solo song above 9 in this banger track. The title alone is fire, as it\u2019s not just a combination of the very popular movie Oppenheimer mixed with Gucci Mane\u2019s nickname \u201cThe Wop,\u201d but it\u2019s also a testament to Gucci Mane\u2019s legacy that he backs up in the lyrics of this song. He doesn\u2019t say it in so many words with this song, but Gucci Mane\u2019s invention of trap is as influential to music as J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s invention of the atomic bomb is influential to science and war. In short, Gucci Mane compares himself to J. Robert Oppenheimer with this track because both were vastly influential in different fields. I\u2019m still not convinced that Gucci Mane was the sole inventor of trap music, but then again, Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t the sole inventor of the atomic bomb, so the comparison works pretty well. \u201cYou was hot in early 2000\u2019s, but how \u2018bout recently?\u201d Gucci Mane asks those he came up in the game alongside multiple times on this song. This track is another one where Gucci Mane cements his legacy and continues his resurgence in the music industry. The production on this song isn\u2019t anything special, but Gucci Mane\u2019s flows and lyrics on this song take a beat that\u2019s good but not great and push it to the limit. I remember listening to this track with my good friend Julian (a frequent contributor to the review page who has done many joint reviews with me) after our joint review of Gucci Mane\u2019s Mr. Davis and him making a comment that this song was \u201cbetter than pretty much everything on Mr. Davis.\u201d Revisiting it now, I\u2019d have to agree with him.\u201cHurt People\u201d: With this song and \u201cBroken Hearted,\u201d I understand what Gucci Mane is trying to do: Make emotionally charged tracks where he can really explore his emotions and talk about difficult topics that he doesn\u2019t normally discuss in his music, but he needs to find a different way to do it. Singing in auto-tune on the chorus with terrible lyrics and awful singing definitely is not the way to do it. The verses on both of these songs also sound disingenuous and as if Gucci Mane is trying too hard to make a track that will tug on people\u2019s heartstrings rather than just saying what he\u2019s feeling. Both of these songs suffer from the same things: A horrendously awful chorus with trash lyrics and terrible singing in auto-tune, two verses that both sound forced and disingenuous rather than heartfelt and emotional, and production that sounds overly sappy and tries too hard to sound \u201csad\u201d and \u201cemotional.\u201d Gucci Mane needs to just rap about what he\u2019s feeling instead of making songs he thinks will get people feeling emotional.It\u2019s rare that an album with an ambitious title that signals the direction the artist is going with their work ever lives up to that ambitious title. Recent examples include Lil Yachty\u2019s Let\u2019s Start Here. (January of 2023) and Miley Cyrus\u2019 Endless Summer Vacation (March of 2023), both of which promised to usher in bold new eras for the artists, but ultimately fell short of being good albums. Lil Yachty\u2019s album delivered on its promise to be experimental and different, and though it was better than anything he had previously released, it was not an overall good album. Travis Scott\u2019s UTOPIA is an exception to this rule, as in addition to being a psychedelic trap utopia as it promised to be, it was the best album released in 2023. This album\u2019s title is Breath Of Fresh Air, and that\u2019s exactly what it is for Gucci Mane\u2019s career. I might go as far as to say it\u2019s the best album I\u2019ve ever heard from him. On Gucci Mane\u2019s chart-topping 2017 album Mr. Davis, it suffices to say he got carried by features, and that the album\u2019s success was mostly driven by the sister song to Migos\u2019 \u201cSlippery (feat. Gucci Mane)\u201d from their excellent album Culture: \u201cI Get The Bag (feat. Migos),\u201d which is an excellent song, but it was the only great track on that album, and not because of Gucci Mane. Gucci Mane\u2019s albums Delusions Of Grandeur (2019) and Ice Daddy (2021) are all but irrelevant, as there were a couple of good songs on the latter but none on the former. On this album, Gucci Mane showed up in a way he hasn\u2019t on any of his previous albums. He had the best solo songs of his career with \u201cMust Be Me,\u201d \u201cMarried With Millions,\u201d and \u201cWoppenheimer,\u201d and instead of being carried by features, the featured artists actually brought Gucci Mane down for the most part. \u201cTalkin To The Streets (feat. Mac Critter)\u201d & \u201cPissy (feat. Roddy Ricch & Nardo Wick)\u201d are both songs that would\u2019ve been better if they\u2019d been solo Gucci Mane songs, and \u201cPissy (feat. Roddy Ricch & Nardo Wick)\u201d was even a revitalization for Roddy Ricch, who has been mid ever since his 2021 album LIVE LIFE FAST. Gucci Mane scored a 10 with the excellent banger \u201cBluffin (feat. Lil Baby & Indyah),\u201d and when his solo songs weren\u2019t good, they were mostly mid, which is definitely a W for Gucci Mane. However, there were flashes of the old, bad Gucci Mane on this album, especially towards the end, where \u201cBig Boy Diamonds (feat. Kodak Black & London On Da Track)\u201d showed how bad Gucci Mane used to be. I don\u2019t know why it was included on this album since it had already been released on Woptober II in 2019. The two Young Dolph collaborations were flops, and the DaBaby & 21 Savage collab proved how far DaBaby has fallen off, and that his fall-off will likely continue even further. Towards the end of the album, Gucci Mane tried a few new things and sang on some choruses with auto-tune, which proved to be a massive L for him. Although the rating may not reflect it, this album was Gucci Mane\u2019s best work that I\u2019ve heard so far. In an era where the future seems uncertain for rap superstar titans like Drake and Lil Wayne, a resurgent Gucci Mane may be exactly what hip-hop needs.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released October 13, 2023Genres: Rage, Trap, Pop RapTracks:Green Room \u2013 3.2Jennifer\u2019s Body \u2013 2.6Fighting My Demons \u2013 3.6Singapore (feat.

I\u2019ve never been impressed with Ken Carson when I\u2019ve heard him on other rage rap artists\u2019 albums (i.e. Yeat & Destroy Lonely), but when he dropped this album, which was immensely hyped up because of its high rating on Pitchfork (7.8, which beat out Offset\u2019s SET IT OFF and Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) to take the top spot on Pitchfork\u2019s album chart for October of 2023) and the co-signs it received from the likes of Playboi Carti, Destroy Lonely, Lil Uzi Vert, and even Drake (who has tried and failed to do the same genre as these guys with his multiple rage songs on For All The Dogs), I decided to give him a chance and do a review of one of his full projects. This intro track is making me regret that decision immensely. Over a lazily produced and half-baked F1LTHY beat, Ken Carson raps in a mundane, contrived, trite, and annoyingly basic vocal cadence where he gives two verses and a chorus that could define the term \u201cmumble rap.\u201d On his first verse, the only words I can make out are the N-word and \u201cb****,\u201d as he\u2019s just mumbling incoherently for the majority of that verse, and on his second verse, Ken Carson raps more clearly, but what he\u2019s saying is vapid, hedonistic, thoughtless, and without emotion. The chorus, led by the statement \u201cThis s\u2014 ain\u2019t make no sense / How I went from broke to rich,\u201d is bad, and Ken Carson\u2019s disbelief of his success is equally as confounding for me as it is for him. From this track, all I can gather about Ken Carson is that he was broke and now he\u2019s rich, and that he has the most basic and generic rapper personality imaginable. There\u2019s nothing remotely unique, different, individualized, or good about this song: it sounds like it was made by Ghostwriter\u2019s AI program by using stems from songs by Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Destroy Lonely, and Yeat. It\u2019s very trash and I have a feeling I know why Anthony Fantano gave Ken Carson\u2019s X album a 0/10.\u201cJennifer\u2019s Body\u201d: A \u201cgoofy aah\u201d beat where Ken Carson raps offbeat for the majority of the song and gives a plethora of terrible lines in his two verses. The title is an obvious reference to the horror movie Jennifer\u2019s Body starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried, but the chorus is the only thing that even remotely references that movie. The movie is terrible, but this song is even worse. Ken Carson\u2019s lyricism so far on this album has been the equivalent of Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s \u201cWorld Class Sinner / I\u2019m A Freak\u201d for rage music, and this song takes the cringe to a whole other level. Ken Carson is just saying random stuff on this song, putting in vulgar lines for some form of \u201cshock value,\u201d and then following them up with lines that shout out someone he knows. This song is one of the most ridiculous collections of non sequiturs I\u2019ve ever heard, and it seems like Ken Carson is only furthering his image as the \u201cbasic, generic, cliche rapper\u201d with this song and these lyrics. I think this album is gonna be a long one.\u201cFighting My Demons\u201d: Ken Carson blatantly copies Playboi Carti\u2019s flow, vocal cadence, and vocal delivery style from Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cFE!N (feat. Playboi Carti & Sheck Wes)\u201d on this song and completely butchers it and waters it down in the process. Again, Ken Carson comes in with the most ridiculous and sporadic non sequiturs ever, spacing them out with repetitive ad-libs and \u201chuh-huh-huh\u201d parts. This song is so unoriginal and dumb that it\u2019s laughable. Ken Carson says nothing of value in his verse, as it\u2019s hard to remember any of his lyrics and he completely fails to create any sense of hype with his vocal delivery or flow. The production on this song is mildly better than it\u2019s been so far on this album, but this track\u2019s melody sounds like it\u2019s trying to be Playboi Carti\u2019s \u201cVamp Anthem\u201d (another horrendously garbage song) while also trying to be light, airy, and uplifting. It\u2019s weird, but there are parts that work somewhat well. Another L for Ken Carson.\u201cSingapore (feat. Destroy Lonely)\u201d: Aside from a few W NFL and NBA reference that included shoutouts to LeBron James (i.e. \u201cI got rich before I turned 23, like LeBron James\u201d) and Stephen Curry, as well as a play on words about the Baltimore Ravens that was actually well-executed, this song is trash. Ken Carson & Destroy Lonely both sucked on this song, and I would say Ken Carson did better than Destroy Lonely, but they were both bad, so it was hard to say who did better. At the very least, Ken Carson rapped on the beat for his first verse, which is something I can\u2019t say for Destroy Lonely. The chorus from Ken Carson had a few good moments, but it was delivered in a mundane, half-baked, trite, and contrived vocal cadence that sounded lazy and thoughtless. One of the main problems I have with Ken Carson is that he sounds like he doesn\u2019t put any thought, care, or emotion into his music. His vocals and lyrics have continuously shown this fact on every song, and it\u2019s getting to the point where I just wanna stop listening because Ghostwriter\u2019s AI program could make probably better and more evocative, hype, and nuanced rage music than Ken Carson.\u201cIt\u2019s Over\u201d: I thought Ken Carson was about to take a rare W when he said \u201cI got this blonde b**** / She tryna suck me, she go blonde, yeah,\u201d but then he proceeded to fumble the bag by saying \u201cShe goin\u2019 dumb, yeah, this b\u2014- goin\u2019 Legally Blonde, yeah\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m \u2018bout to pass her to my bro, yeah.\u201d A regular bag fumble for Ken Carson, my man made a bad song, dissed a great movie, and dissed a blonde girl in the process. It seems that Ken Carson will be a great candidate for the Professional Bag Fumbling Hall Of Fame. This album has already been bad, but now that he\u2019s talking smack about blonde girls (my type) and Legally Blonde, he\u2019s taking next-level L\u2019s. It\u2019s as if Ken Carson made this emotionless, thoughtless, lifeless, basic, bland, contrived, and trite album just to piss me off. I can assure you it\u2019s working.\u201cLike This (feat. Destroy Lonely & Lil Uzi Vert)\u201d: One of the only songs I was looking forward to listening to on this album, and it\u2019s absolutely atrociously bad in every way it can possibly be. The chorus is completely offbeat, and it\u2019s just Ken Carson repeating \u201cBalmain jeans fit like this\u201d four times before Destroy Lonely repeats \u201cWhy my b**** look like this?\u201d four times before Lil Uzi Vert repeats \u201cHow I make a hit like this?\u201d four times. They\u2019re all offbeat, the chorus is repetitive and dumb, and the verses that follow each of these choruses on the song are horrendously awful. Each artist gets two verses on this song; the first and the fourth verses from Ken Carson bleed into the second and fifth verses from Destroy Lonely, and neither of them say anything of remote value on the song, as their verses are complete filler and they contribute absolutely nothing. The third and sixth verses from Lil Uzi Vert are indicative of the worst parts of Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s Pink Tape album, as he says some extremely out of pocket things while also having terrible flows, weak vocal delivery that sounds dumbed-down to fit the styles of Ken Carson & Destroy Lonely, and his lyrics are overall just uninspired and bad. The production is incredibly mid, as the melody is overly repetitive and the drum pattern is static and hollow. Overall, a complete and utter flop from two artists who are currently dominating the rage music scene\u2026 and Ken Carson.\u201cRockstar Lifestyle\u201d: \u201cIf I bought her a$$ & titties, yeah, then I built her.\u201d \u201cRockstar lifestyle, yeah, I been off these drugs.\u201d Dang, Ken Carson is really living up to his claim on \u201cGreen Room\u201d when he said \u201cI\u2019m an a$$hole.\u201d Although Ken Carson is infamous for saying that Lil Uzi Vert & Playboi Carti were \u201cthe first Black men to indulge in the rockstar lifestyle\u201d (I\u2019m not even sure where he got that idea since rock music was invented by Black people and Jimi Hendrix is one of the greatest indulgers of the rockstar lifestyle of all time and the GOAT guitarist), this song is probably the best track on this album. The production, which includes a melody based on \u201calarm synths\u201d (a very popular technique in rage music and in 2010\u2019s pop music) and 808s mixed with the drum pattern, is undoubtedly the best beat on this album, and Ken Carson, despite having some very questionable lyrics and mostly trash lines on this song, drops a few banger lines, like \u201cI feel like Drake, b****, I\u2019m So Far Gone\u201d (referencing one of the greatest albums ever), and has some solid flows on this song that don\u2019t sound like he\u2019s trying to imitate anyone else. Although Ken Carson has a terrible understanding of music history and no idea what the rockstar lifestyle truly is, this song is the best on the album despite it still being bad.I went into this album with very low expectations, and it still ended up being way worse than I thought it would\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve heard nothing but bad things about Ken Carson. From his terrible feature on Destroy Lonely\u2019s \u201cmoney & sex (with Ken Carson)\u201d from If Looks Could Kill to his comments that Lil Uzi Vert & Playboi Carti were the first Black rock stars to \u201cindulge in the rockstar lifestyle\u201d (as if Jimi Hendrix doesn\u2019t exist) to his 0/10 score on Anthony Fantano\u2019s channel for his album X, I could only assume that Ken Carson was an L individual. Judging from this album, he is an L individual and then some. The only parts of this album I liked were when Ken Carson made references to things I liked, such as the NFL, the NBA, Drake, Travis Scott, and a few other things. He could\u2019ve taken a W with me for his blonde girl reference on \u201cIt\u2019s Over,\u201d but he horrendously fumbled the bag with it. Everything else about this album absolutely sucked. The production on this album was extraordinarily bad, as each beat took a single element of rage music production and focused solely on it, neglecting everything else rage music needs to sound good, with the notable exception of \u201cRockstar Lifestyle.\u201d The features from Destroy Lonely (3 times) and Lil Uzi Vert were terrible, as Ken Carson dragged them down with him as opposed to them lifting Ken Carson up. Although production and features were trash, the thing that sucked the most about this album was Ken Carson. His lyrics, vocals, flows, and subjects on this album all show a total sense of apathy from the rapper. Ken Carson sounds as if he\u2019s putting the smallest amount of effort possible into making his music. He sounds apathetic and neglectful on all of the songs on this album. No emotion is shown at any point on the album, and Ken Carson raps about what everyone else raps about, only it\u2019s not personalized or individualized in any way. He sounds like an AI program based on songs by Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, Destroy Lonely & Yeat. I was going to review his album X to see why Anthony Fantano gave it a 0/10 score, but after reviewing this album, I\u2019m not sure that I could stand it.

Madonna & Playboi Carti)\u201d: For the lead single and most popular (no pun intended) song from the soundtrack to his HBO TV series The Idol, The Weeknd assembled the Avengers for an amazingly epic synthpop song. The Weeknd is undoubtedly one of the most influential and formative artists for modern pop, R&B, and synthpop music, and for this song, he recruited another artist who has defined the genres of pop and synthpop: Madonna, also known as the Queen of Pop. Not only did the modern-day Michael Jackson (although that claim is heavily debated, The Weeknd takes heavy influence from MJ) make the collaboration that never happened between Madonna & MJ with this song, but he also recruited another artist who is to rage rap what he & Madonna are to pop: Playboi Carti. This lineup is insane by itself, as I never thought I\u2019d hear The Weeknd & Madonna on a song together, let alone Madonna & Playboi Carti on a song together! However, the assemblage of the Avengers doesn\u2019t end there. The producers of this song are all top 10 all-time GOAT producers: Metro Boomin, MIKE DEAN, and The Weeknd, who all show their versatility with this synthpop banger that incorporates elements of pop rap. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a MIKE DEAN song without a synth intro or outro, and his synths alongside Madonna\u2019s voice sound epic. The first and third verse from The Weeknd on this song detail the life of the main character in his show The Idol, popstar Jocelyn (played by Lily-Rose Depp), and the chorus brings it home with details on what she would do \u201cto be popular.\u201d All of The Weeknd\u2019s parts on this song are awesome, and the second verse from Madonna is equally great. Playboi Carti\u2019s bridge and post-chorus is definitely a different touch for this song, but his high-pitched delivery and mumbled lyrics are actually a great juxtaposition to The Weeknd\u2019s silky smooth voice and Madonna\u2019s harmonizing with him. Although The Idol as a show is cringe (I\u2019ll get into that later), this song is amazing.\u201cDollhouse (with Lily-Rose Depp)\u201d: A psychedelic synthpop song with excellent production from The Weeknd & MIKE DEAN that beautifully incorporates MIKE DEAN\u2019s ethereal GOATed synth melodies alongside psychedelic trap drums and amazing guitar riffs that sound like they could\u2019ve been done by Pink Floyd\u2019s David Gilmour. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how Lily-Rose Depp would sound on this song, as her vocals on the song \u201cWorld Class Sinner / I\u2019m A Freak\u201d are unbelievably flat and lifeless, but on here, Johnny Depp\u2019s daughter and the star of The Idol channels her popstar persona perfectly and sounds like a mix between Lana Del Rey and Miley Cyrus on this song. Her two verses and chorus are amazingly well done with great lyrics and sultry, seductive vocals that are delivered perfectly against the psychedelic, dark synth instrumental. The Weeknd\u2019s ad-libs on Lily-Rose\u2019s verses are amazing, but he really steals the show with his third verse, which is absolutely incredible and has vocals that are among his very best. The subject matter of this song, which is about an abusive relationship, is portrayed brilliantly by The Weeknd\u2019s short but impactful verse and the evocative nature of the lyrics and vocals from both artists. I expected this song to be a flop because of Lily-Rose Depp, but she really surprised me on this song with an excellent performance.\u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d by Torye Sivan: The original song, \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d by George Harrison, is a great track that\u2019s featured on the Guardians Of The Galaxy Awesome Mix Vol. 2, and this song is a faithful replication of the original track while providing an added layer of nuance while also being stripped down and featuring less instrumentation than the original song. The instrumental is just what would happen if George Harrison\u2019s guitar was replaced with MIKE DEAN\u2019s synth chords, and there are very subtle yet impactful 808 chords throughout as well. Torye Sivan does a very good job with the vocals on this song, as I didn\u2019t think his voice would be deep enough or powerful enough to fill George Harrison\u2019s shoes, but he did a very good job with delivering evocative vocals on this track that not only faithfully replicated George Harrison\u2019s, but even surpassed him in some respects. Torye Sivan falters only a few times, but his missteps are few and far between on this psychedelic synthpop version of the former Beatles member\u2019s classic track. Great song, very impressive performance by Torye Sivan.\u201cLike A God\u201d: The two verses from The Weeknd are not his best, but they\u2019re both good in that they advance the narrative of the song (by portraying the points of view of the characters Jocelyn & Tedros, played by Lily-Rose Depp & The Weeknd in the show, respectively) and have some good vocal moments. The lyrics aren\u2019t The Weeknd\u2019s best, but he gets the job done relatively well. The chorus is the best part of the song, as the vocals, flows, lyrics, and overall grandiose nature are all done spectacularly well. The production from MIKE DEAN & The Weeknd shows more use of dark synth melodies and sporadic drums, which continues to advance the suspenseful and foreboding mood of this album. It\u2019s clear that MIKE DEAN & The Weeknd drew a lot of inspiration from Depeche Mode on this album, and it\u2019s awesome. Another very good song from The Weeknd; his first solo effort on the album is a banger.\u201cFalse Idols (feat. Lil Baby & Suzanna Son)\u201d: Woah! This track is absolutely amazing! I had no idea this song would be so good, but each artist contributed something different to this track and did their absolute best on it. The production on this song from The Weeknd & MIKE DEAN is so incredibly intuitive that it can sound like a psychedelic, dark synthpop beat while form-fitting to the styles of Lil Baby, The Weeknd, and Suzanna Son, who are three totally different artists. That\u2019s why MIKE DEAN & The Weeknd are in the top 10 all-time GOAT producers list. Not many people can make a beat that sounds so unique while also being perfect for three entirely different artists. The first verse from Lil Baby was absolutely fire! The verse was one of the best features I\u2019ve ever heard from him; the flow-switches were insanely good, the lyrics were great, the vocal delivery was perfect, and Lil Baby sounded like a next level artist on this song. He sounded like he was rapping on his 2020 album My Turn but with production from MIKE DEAN & The Weeknd. If only he had done something like this song on It\u2019s Only Me because this track was better than anything on that album by a mile. The chorus from Suzanna Son is way better than her solo track; not my favorite, but a solid transition between verses. The Weeknd\u2019s second verse shows him rapping melodically and using flow switches where he goes between singing and rapping effortlessly, all while singing from the perspective of his character Tedros and from his own perspective. Truly an amazing verse from him with vocals, lyrics, and flows. The outro from Suzanna Son has me wondering why she ever made a track as terrible as \u201cCrocodile Tears.\u201d The MIKE DEAN synth outro coupled with her ethereal vocals is eargasmic, and it\u2019s an awesome way to end a track where both Lil Baby & The Weeknd popped off.\u201cJealous Guy\u201d: I know this song is a cover of John Lennon\u2019s \u201cJealous Guy\u201d (the second solo Beatles cover on this album, go figure), but what I did not know is that Donny Hathaway\u2019s version of \u201cJealous Guy\u201d is sampled in Pusha T\u2019s \u201cDreamin Of The Past (feat. Kanye West)\u201d! The first lines of this song are \u201cI was dreaming of the past / And my heart was beatin\u2019 fast,\u201d which is the main sample loop for that song! An epic connection between two great artists here. At this point, I kinda want Kanye West to reproduce the beat for Pusha T\u2019s \u201cDreamin Of The Past (feat. Kanye West),\u201d but with sampling The Weeknd\u2019s vocals instead of Donny Hathaway\u2019s. However, aside from the original track\u2019s instrumental being replaced with MIKE DEAN\u2019s synth chords, there\u2019s nothing too special about this song. The Weeknd seems to be going through the motions with his vocals and flows on this song, and MIKE DEAN\u2019s synth arpeggios can be too much at times. Overall mid, but I would like to see a new version of that Pusha T & Kanye song with The Weeknd\u2019s vocals sampled on it.\u201cFill The Void (with Lily-Rose Depp & Ramsey)\u201d: Not a huge fan of Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s two verses on this song, and while she does a good job on the chorus and Ramsey does a great job with her post-chorus, Lily-Rose Depp is the weakest link on this track. When The Weeknd comes in on the third verse, that\u2019s when the track really becomes very good. The Weeknd delivers a great verse and makes a previously dormant beat from him & MIKE DEAN come alive, and the outro with The Weeknd\u2019s auto-tuned harmonizing and MIKE DEAN\u2019s synths is perhaps the best part of the song. The outro definitely sounds like something Kanye West or Travis Scott would do with MIKE DEAN\u2019s production, so I\u2019m glad to see The Weeknd becoming just as comfortable with MIKE DEAN as those two amazing artists. Good song overall, but I wish Lily-Rose Depp had not been on it.\u201cGet It B4\u201d by Moses Sumney: Moses Sumney is an extremely enigmatic artist. He\u2019s done everything from working with James Blake & Metro Boomin on James Blake\u2019s Assume Form album to covering Metallica\u2019s \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d on The Metallica Blacklist album, and all the while, he\u2019s remained mysterious about his genre. If I had to classify his genre, I\u2019d say he\u2019s either an \u201cart neo-soul,\u201d \u201cexperimental sophisti-pop,\u201d or \u201cart jazz\u201d artist. He\u2019s worked with everyone from James Blake to Metro Boomin to Sufjan Stevens, and apparently, he\u2019s an actor as well since he\u2019s in The Idol alongside The Weeknd and various other celebrities who were previously known only for music. This song is very interesting. It\u2019s produced by Moses Sumney, Oneohtrix Point Never (a producer who worked extensively on The Weeknd\u2019s Dawn FM album), and Kyla Moscovich; and it sounds like a Kendrick Lamar song with a touch of synthpop, psychedelia, and mellow jazz. The different vocal cadences Moses Sumney uses on his two verses show extreme versatility, and with both voices, Moses Sumney sounds amazing and his lo-fi, laid-back, and relaxed vocal cadence is absolutely perfect for this odd and often surprisingly amazing instrumental. Moses talks about fantasizing about a hot girl he\u2019s been crushing on for a long time and finally getting to be with her intimately, which is a relatable and amazingly conveyed concept on this song. The horns are arranged brilliantly and the electronic sound effects show a brilliant fusion of genres. What a great display of experimental genre-bending.\u201cFamily (with Suzanna Son)\u201d: Probably the worst song The Weeknd has ever been associated with. All of the points on this song come from The Weeknd\u2019s triumphant and amazing non-lyric vocals at the end of the song which leads into MIKE DEAN\u2019s spacey synth outro. The vocals and lyrics from Suzanna Son\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say they\u2019re depressing, iconoclastic, nihilistic, and absolutely ridiculous. I\u2019ll leave it at that. The Weeknd should not have attached himself to this song and just let Suzanna Son take the L.\u201cDouble Fantasy (feat. Future)\u201d: The Weeknd, MIKE DEAN, Metro Boomin, and Future. Is there any way this song is not gonna be a banger? The Weeknd & Future have a great track record on collaborations, and this song only adds to their list of great songs with another perfect 10. The jazzy horns on the intro are great, but they\u2019re soon broken down by MIKE DEAN\u2019s ethereal synth melody and Metro Boomin\u2019s hard-hitting drums that come in alongside the synth melody after The Weeknd\u2019s first chorus. Both The Weeknd & Future have great verses on this song, and they both discuss a lustful relationship with a girl they know it\u2019s wrong for them to be with, but they can\u2019t help it because of the pleasures they feel when they\u2019re with her. Hedonistic pleasure is the main theme of this song, and who better to do it than The Weeknd & Future over a beat from three all-time GOAT producers? The chorus from The Weeknd ties the song together perfectly, and the vocals, lyrics, and flows from both artists are on point. Great song.\u201cWorld Class Sinner / I\u2019m A Freak\u201d by Lily-Rose Depp: If anyone needs an explanation as to why The Weeknd & Sam Levinson\u2019s The Idol TV Show is bad, point them in the direction of this song: A \u201cpop song\u201d sung from the perspective of Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s character Jocelyn, the promiscuous popstar, in The Idol. This song is laughably bad. The songwriting is pure and utter unfiltered cringe. It\u2019s supposed to be because the characters in the show make fun of it, but even still, the fact that someone wrote these lyrics and told Lily-Rose Depp \u201csing this\u201d is absolutely wild. I can imagine MIKE DEAN\u2019s reaction when he was told to make a beat for this ridiculous and stupidly bad song. Both Lily-Rose Depp & MIKE DEAN are talented artists, so the fact that either of them would be associated with a song that\u2019s actually horrific for the purpose of a TV show is pretty rough. The lyrics are hilariously cringe, and the vocals from Lily-Rose Depp sound flat and uninspired. But, then again, how could they not with how bad the lyrics are?The Idol. The Weeknd & Sam Levinson\u2019s (the creator of the HBO series Euphoria) HBO passion project. Since its release, The Idol has been called \u201cthe worst TV show in modern history,\u201d been called \u201cthe cringiest show of all time,\u201d has not been renewed for a second season, and was cut short from 6 to 5 episodes because of horrific critical reception. The show\u2019s premise centers around popstar Jocelyn (played by Lily-Rose Depp) and her meeting cult leader and club owner Tedros (played by The Weeknd) much to the chagrin of her PR team and personal staff. The show is responsible for some of the worst dialogue in history, including an infamous scene in episode 3 where Jocelyn (Depp) tells Tedros (The Weeknd), \u201cTo be honest, I think you\u2019re gay,\u201d to which he responds in the most deadpan way possible \u201cI ain\u2019t gay.\u201d I won\u2019t talk about any more of the cringe moments from the show because it could be its own review, and the show has severely impacted The Weeknd\u2019s legacy because of how cringe it is. However, although the show is cringe, the soundtrack produced quite a few bangers. If this album was solely an album by The Weeknd, it wouldn\u2019t be his best work, but it would be a lot better than it is with the other artists included on it. The Weeknd takes some L\u2019s on this album, no doubt about it, as \u201cA Lesser Man\u201d & \u201cTake Me Back\u201d are both painstakingly boring solo songs with bad lyrics and mundane vocals, and the vulgar nature of \u201cOne Of The Girls (with JENNIE & Lily-Rose Depp)\u201d makes it almost unlistenable, but for the most part, The Weeknd makes some great music on here. In tandem with MIKE DEAN, these two top 10 all-time GOAT producers make some insanely good synthpop and psychedelic music, taking influence from everyone from Depeche Mode to New Order to even Pink Floyd on some songs. Metro Boomin also assists here and there, which can never be a bad thing since he\u2019s also a top 10 GOAT who has a rapport with both The Weeknd & MIKE DEAN. The Weeknd excels on collaborations on this album with the exception of \u201cFamily (with Suzanna Son),\u201d which is basically a Suzanna Son song anyway. The Weeknd has a proven track record, as do MIKE DEAN & Metro Boomin, so I was expecting bangers from them, but a few other artists really surprised me on this album. Torye Sivan delivered a great cover of George Harrison\u2019s \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d on here, Moses Sumney teamed up with Oneohtrix Point Never for an art-jazz / neo-soul banger \u201cGet It B4,\u201d and Lily-Rose Depp, the daughter of Johnny Depp and star of the show, really impressed me with her vocal talents. It\u2019s a shame \u201cWorld Class Sinner / I\u2019m A Freak\u201d exists because she\u2019s a great singer and should probably have launched a career by this point. However, with the cringe that is The Idol, most people are attempting to distance themselves from it rather than taking credit for what happened in it. There will be a considerable skew in this overall rating because of how abhorrently trash some of the songs on this album were, but I think it suffices to say that The Weeknd still cannot be stopped and is only getting better as an artist. He just needs to focus his efforts on music rather than acting.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released October 13, 2023Genres: Trap, Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop Rap, Rage, Dirty SouthTracks:ON THE RIVER (feat.

Offset is off to a hot start with this song. The production from Southside includes a melancholy piano melody alongside energetic and fast-paced trap drums coupled with a vocal sample from singer-songwriter KIRBY\u2019s \u201cBlack Leaves,\u201d and it\u2019s definitely different from what I\u2019m used to hearing from Southside. However, he stepped outside his comfort zone and did a great job with this beat. KIRBY\u2019s hauntingly good vocals mixed with the melancholy piano and energetic trap drum pattern was a perfect combination. The only complaint that I have with this song is that I wish it was longer. However, I don\u2019t think it needed to be because on this song, Offset did a single verse where he made a few things very clear: This album will be true to its title in that he will definitely set it off (i.e. set the music industry on fire), he \u201cbecame the one when he got out the group\u201d (which is a very sad line for a Migos fan like myself, but I\u2019m glad Offset is feeling confident and ready to make music again in the wake of Takeoff\u2019s tragic murder), and that he\u2019s him. Offset really is \u201cthat guy,\u201d and he\u2019s coming to show everyone that with this album. Amazing opener.\u201cSAY MY GRACE (feat. Travis Scott)\u201d: \u201cGotta ask God \u2018why me?\u2019,\u201d \u201cWhy I lose my brother to bullets? / Why I lose my grandma to cancer?\u201d Offset asks God on his first verse of this excellent song with production from frequent Drake collaborators Maneesh, Vinylz, and FNZ. The production on this song is excellent; the trumpets and violins from Vinylz & FNZ give a grandiose and almost gaudy orchestral sound to the song, while Maneesh\u2019s drums and beat switches hit as hard on this song as they did on Drake\u2019s poignant Views intro track \u201cKeep The Family Close,\u201d which Maneesh also produced. The chorus from Offset is great, as it shows incredible versatility and mastery of flows, as Offset almost sings his ad-libs and raps in a much slower cadence than he\u2019s used to. Offset continues the greatness into the first verse, which is absolutely excellent. It is an emotional plea and a display of vulnerability the likes of which has seldom been seen in Offset\u2019s music with and without Migos. Offset came out of the Migos breakup looking like the bad guy, and it was never confirmed whether he reconciled things with Quavo & Takeoff before Takeoff\u2019s death, so the fact that Offset is referencing Takeoff\u2019s passing and the immense effect it had on him speaks volumes to how much he cares about his family. In all honesty, Offset has already said more about Takeoff and how he feels about the tragic murder than Quavo did on his entire Rocket Power album, which was ultimately a botched tribute to the slain Migos star. The second verse from Travis Scott simply shows how much of a run he\u2019s on in 2023. The verse is excellent, as he has great lyrics, flows, vocal delivery, and his use of auto-tune juxtaposed with Maneesh\u2019s hard drums is amazingly executed. Travis Scott dropped the AOTY of 2023 and one of the greatest albums of all time not five months ago, and he\u2019s not letting people forget it. Offset is 2-0 in his first two songs, and they\u2019re both perfect 10s. Already this album is better than Quavo\u2019s.\u201cWORTH IT (feat. Don Toliver)\u201d: Offset is undoubtedly going on a heater right now. 3-0 with 3 perfect 10s to begin his album! I know how he feels right now having taken some massive Ws in my personal life recently. The production from CHASETHEMONEY is mellow, laid-back, low-key, and somewhat psychedelic, and this song sounds as if it could\u2019ve fit right in on Don Toliver\u2019s Love Sick album (and it probably would\u2019ve been the best song on that album or tied for it). The chorus from Don Toliver is better than pretty much anything he did on Love Sick; it\u2019s absolutely awesome. His lo-fi and mellow vocals blend perfectly with the production, and Offset\u2019s two verses on here are both amazing. Offset starts the first verse as if he\u2019s trying to rap in his normal surgical, technical, fast-paced cadence, but he switches up quickly and starts rapping melodically, which sounds absolutely amazing. His vocals have improved an extreme amount since his last album (and even since Migos\u2019 Culture III), as I used to dread when Offset would sing on a Migos song, but he sounds amazing on this track. The melodic rapping flow suits him quite well, and the amount of emotion he pours into each line he gives on this song (the subject matter is unconfirmed, but it\u2019s quite likely he\u2019s airing the dirty laundry in his relationship with Cardi B or with one of his ex-girlfriends) is palpable. Offset is coming with some very emotionally charged lyrics and vocals on this album, and it\u2019s leading him to make what is sounding like a contender for the 2023 AOTY or one of the top spots.\u201cBROAD DAY (feat. Future)\u201d: Well, unfortunately, it was too good to last. This song sucks. The chorus from Offset is bad, the first verse from Offset has a few good moments but is ultimately mid at best, and the second verse from Future is horrendously awful. The whistling ad-libs, the trash flow, the weird vocal cadence, and the wack bars like \u201cB**** hide that dope in her cleavage\u201d made this song terrible. The production is also mid at best, as the beat is sort of a lesser version of NAV\u2019s \u201cMismatch (feat. Babyface Ray)\u201d with goofy sounding synths on the chorus. Bad song.\u201cFAN\u201d: The intro for this song, where Offset touchingly introduces a song that\u2019s in the style of Three 6 Mafia and Memphis rage with soft, melodic singing, is absolutely amazing. I love Offset\u2019s lyrics, as they\u2019re very motivational and full of emotion. I loved his line \u201cTired of stressin\u2019 over what I can\u2019t control,\u201d as it\u2019s something I strive to live by as well. The chorus is a fist-pumping, crowd moving affirmation of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d (not in so many words) by Offset to everyone who has tried to screw him over in his life, and it\u2019s great. However, his verse once the Memphis rage beat gets going is not very good, as it\u2019s pretty mid overall due to some cringe sex lines and other bad stuff, but once he adopts the Project Pat flow in the final few lines of his verse (much like 21 Savage did on Drake\u2019s \u201cKnife Talk (feat. 21 Savage & Project Pat)\u201d), the song turned around again and finished strong. Solid track.\u201cFREAKY (feat. Cardi B)\u201d: I expected this song to be bad, but not this bad! This track is an 0.1! Offset & Cardi B have collabed many times in the past, as the two are married and share several children, and while the idea of a couple making a song together is romantic and cool, this song is done in all the wrong ways. First of all, the production sounds like a garbage Doja Cat type beat that\u2019s trying too hard to be \u201cemo, edgy pop\u201d while also being trap. Second of all, Cardi B sounds like the bargain brand Doja Cat on the chorus and sounds like her regular garbage self on her verse, so it\u2019s a 2-for-1 special of crap music. Offset\u2019s lyrics on this song are so cringe and abysmally awful that I couldn\u2019t begin to list half of the \u201csus\u201d and vulgar things he says on this track. Talking about making a girl\u2019s baby daddy wanna kill him while rapping on a track with his wife is probably the most tone-deaf thing ever. This song is hot garbage in every sense of the word.\u201cHOP OUT THE VAN\u201d: Offset doing Playboi Carti\u2019s baby voice on the chorus?! What is going on?! Did Offset learn nothing from Drake\u2019s many failures on his For All The Dogs album where he copied the flow of Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Destroy Lonely, Yeat, Ken Carson, and many other electro-rage rappers? I can\u2019t believe Offset would reduce himself to doing that on this chorus. The verse is actually good, as the melodic rapping works well yet again and the auto-tune use is spot on, especially with the backing vocals, but the bridge into the chorus is insanely repetitive and the chorus itself is stupidly lame and a cheap imitation of Playboi Carti\u2019s baby voice. Offset needs to stick to what he\u2019s good at because this trend of popular rappers jumping on the repetitive electro-rage rap trend is not it.\u201cNIGHT VISION\u201d: It\u2019s songs like this one that prove why Metro Boomin is undoubtedly a top 10 all-time GOAT producer and likely a top 5 all-time GOAT. There\u2019s a reason that all three of Metro Boomin\u2019s solo albums (i.e. NOT ALL HEROES WEAR CAPES in 2018, HEROES & VILLAINS in 2022, and the ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE soundtrack in 2023) have been in contention for the AOTY spot of each year they were released (or, in the case of H & V, won the AOTY title), and it\u2019s because Metro Boomin is such an excellent producer who truly understands how to incorporate any artist into his sound while staying true to theirs. The lush synth chords Metro employs on this beat are heavenly, and the drum pattern is brilliantly arranged so Offset can pretty much take the beat in any direction he wants. This song has the same sound (and subject matter) that most of the songs on HEROES & VILLAINS had, which is part of what makes it so good. Offset\u2019s chorus is a bit repetitive, but the auto-tune use, nuanced ad-libs, and eargasmic synth chords from Metro really negate the repetition. The first verse from Offset employs a melodic flow and paints him as a kind of vigilante who has to watch his every move for the opps who would bring him down (ties into the superhero / villain narrative from Metro\u2019s 2022 album). The second verse is very similar in flow, but it\u2019s more personalized to Offset\u2019s own struggles. I\u2019m so glad Metro Boomin showed up on this album to get Offset another much-needed 10, but I\u2019m just disappointed he didn\u2019t show up earlier. Metro Boomin & Zaytoven were staples on Offset\u2019s debut album FATHER OF 4, so it\u2019s surprising to not have heard Zaytoven yet and only heard Metro once.\u201cSKYAMI (feat. Mango Foo)\u201d: On a BNYX\u00ae type beat that sounds like a Yeat song with ethereal synth chords and a buzzing synth melody that\u2019s produced by 2Epik, SMPLGTWY, and Boi-1da (who handled the hard-hitting drum pattern on this track that\u2019s perhaps one of the best production moments on the song), Offset delivers a melodic chorus that sounds great with this ethereal rage beat that sounds like Yeat could\u2019ve been featured on it. The chorus is definitely Offset\u2019s best contribution to the song, as his second verse is good, but it\u2019s held back from greatness by a few bad lines. Although, I wouldn\u2019t count his verse out, though, as there are a few bangers in there like \u201cLike a tornado, get spinned with no warning.\u201d Mango Foo definitely stole the show on this song, though, as his higher-pitched vocal cadence and auto-tune use in his flow made for an amazing verse where he simply went off and delivered some great lyrics with a great flow. Rage has finally worked in Offset\u2019s favor, but it\u2019s definitely not a genre he should try to make many more songs in (at the very least, not by himself).\u201cFINE AS CAN BE (feat. Latto)\u201d: The Latto verse is pure and unfiltered cringe at its finest. I had no idea it was even possible for someone to talk about oral sex on every single line of a verse, but Latto managed to do it in the most vulgar and disgusting way possible on this song. As soon as Latto said, \u201cThey all sayin\u2019 that Latto be spittin\u2019 / If you ask my man, he say I be swallowin\u2019,\u201d I had to completely skip the track. Latto is going to go down as one of the worst rappers of all time, and she\u2019s just added another verse to her total of garbage ones. The production on this song is actually pretty good, but Offset mostly squanders it with a mid verse and a chorus that\u2019s pretty uninspired and sounds like a less evocative version of Offset\u2019s chorus from Migos\u2019 \u201cHandle My Business.\u201d I still can\u2019t believe how absolutely horrible Cardi B & Latto have been on this album. It\u2019s as if they were trying to give the most awful and egregiously disgusting verses they could on these collabs.\u201cJEALOUSY (feat. Cardi B)\u201d: The production on this song is so bad. The Memphis rage beat that\u2019s made from sampling Three 6 Mafia\u2019s \u201cJealous A$$ B****\u201d is cliche, trite, contrived, and only serves to mess up the flows of Offset & Cardi B on this song. Offset rapped for a solid minute and a half on his first verse, but he sounded as though he was just going through the motions and wasn\u2019t contributing anything of value to the track. His verse was bad because it was boring and too long, and the flow kept being interrupted by the ridiculously bad beat. Cardi B\u2019s second verse was actually good, which was surprising considering how bad her first collab on this album was. Her lyrics were good, her vocal delivery was solid, and her flow was much better than her husband\u2019s flow on the first verse. However, the third and final verse from Cardi B was garbage, as the opening line of it was \u201cIf I had a d\u2014, it\u2019d need to be sucked.\u201d That\u2019s a common theme with Cardi B, unfortunately, and it\u2019s part of the reason she can be so garbage at rapping. Another L collab between Offset & Cardi B.\u201cBLAME IT ON SET\u201d: I\u2019m not sure what Offset was trying to accomplish with this song. The instrumental on this song is mid at best, as it\u2019s often very loud, grating, and annoying, but it\u2019s really Offset\u2019s use of this instrumental that makes it as bad as it is. The constant repetition of \u201cf*** it up\u201d after the chorus and the terrible flows and lyrics on the chorus where Offset tells his haters and other rappers that \u201cthey can\u2019t be too upset\u201d for some reason that\u2019s not well-defined throughout the song. The two verses from Offset on this track are both mid and forgettable, especially since the production is so annoyingly grating and terribly executed. I definitely expected more from a Boi-1da beat, but I imagine he was only tapped for the drums on this song, which were actually executed rather well. I think it\u2019s partially the fatigue of this 21-track album setting in, but this song was total filler.Offset started this album off red hot. After diving headfirst in with the banger intro track \u201cON THE RIVER (feat. KIRBY)\u201d and following it up with Cactus Jack Records\u2019 finest on the emotionally charged tracks \u201cSAY MY GRACE (feat. Travis Scott)\u201d & \u201cWORTH IT (feat. Don Toliver)\u201d that not only addressed Offset\u2019s grief over losing Takeoff but also tapped into emotions he\u2019s not shown very frequently in his music, I was ready to award him with the second best album of 2023 over Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). However, he fumbled the bag on a collab with Future where neither of them performed well, and after \u201cFAN,\u201d the album only got worse and only picked up again when Metro Boomin helped Offset create a track that fit the HEROES & VILLAINS signature sound with \u201cNIGHT VISION.\u201d Offset hit it big once with a rage experiment on \u201cSKYAMI (feat. Mango Foo),\u201d but ultimately, Offset attempting to imitate Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Destroy Lonely, Ken Carson, and Yeat on this album was a total failure and the same trap multiple other famous artists fell into in the same month. Both Drake & Lil Wayne dropped trash albums in October of 2023, and the primary reason was because they tried to step too far outside their comfort zones and try genres like electro-rage rap, Jersey Club, and the Playboi Carti baby voice, which is a genre in and of itself in some respects. Offset fell into the same trap multiple times on this album. If he had just stayed with what he had been doing for the opening few tracks, this album could\u2019ve been one of the best to ever come from a Migos member, but instead, it\u2019ll probably be mentioned in discussions with Quavo\u2019s 2023 album Rocket Power and Quavo\u2019s abhorrent mess of a 2018 album QUAVO HUNCHO. One of the primary problems Offset ran into on this album was the length of the tracklist. Offset probably had enough material on this album to make a solid 10-track album, but he decided to stretch the length to 21 tracks, which resulted in a ton of filler, such as \u201cDISSOLVE,\u201d \u201cBUSS MY WATCH,\u201d \u201cBLAME IT ON SET,\u201d \u201cUPSIDE DOWN,\u201d and \u201cHEALTHY.\u201d Everything after \u201cSKYAMI (feat. Mango Foo)\u201d could be cut, and this album would be a lot better and sound no different. Nothing that came after that song contributed remotely anything to this album. Aside from a few flash-in-the-pan moments of brilliance and a red-hot first three songs, this sophomore album from Offset is mostly filler, bad collaborations, and failed attempts at doing what everyone else in the rap game is doing.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released October 27, 2023Genres: Synthpop, Pop, Elegant PopTracks:Welcome To New York (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 6.6Blank Space (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 8.8Style (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 10Out Of The Woods (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 9.3All You Had To Do Was Stay (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 10Shake It Off (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 9.6I Wish You Would (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 7.6Bad Blood (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 10Wildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 10How You Get The Girl (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 9.8This Love (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 7.8I Know Places (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 10Clean (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 8.5Wonderland (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 7.4You Are In Love (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 9.6New Romantics (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u2013 9.6\u201cSlut!\u201d (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault) \u2013 10Say Don\u2019t Go (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault) \u2013 8.2Now That We Don\u2019t Talk (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault) \u2013 7Suburban Legends (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault) \u2013 7.3Is It Over Now?

If that\u2019s the case for every song on this album, Taylor Swift could have the second best album of 2023 with this Taylor\u2019s Version. Now, I know it\u2019s a bit paradoxical to say that this album is in line for 2023\u2019s AOTY runner-up spot with an intro track that\u2019s rated 6.6, but since this song sounds the exact same as the original, I\u2019m hoping all of the other ones do as well, as 1989 is my favorite Taylor Swift album and has a bunch of good and great songs on it (to my recollection, at least). I\u2019ve never liked \u201cWelcome To New York,\u201d and while it works okay as the intro to Taylor Swift\u2019s first pure pop album after her country and pop country albums since the song is about reinventing yourself and flipping the script, the song is not good. The synth chords are bland, the first verse from Taylor Swift is mid, the second verse is bad, and the chorus is average at best. The lyrics and vocals are filled with tongue-and-cheek optimism, and the song is so overly simplistic and childish that it sounds almost cynical (that\u2019s not her intention, but it\u2019s what the song ends up sounding like). Taylor Swift is talking about new beginnings in a new place, but her happy vocal delivery and simple lyrics are so tongue-and-cheek that this song sounds like it was made to be the theme song to a kids' movie. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s the opening song for The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie I don\u2019t like which has likely influenced why I don\u2019t like this song. If memory serves, though, this song is the worst one on the original 1989, so it should only go up from here.\u201cBlank Space (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: Sounds very similar to the original version, but Taylor Swift sounds more subdued and less seductive on this song than she does on the original one. It sounds like Taylor is going more for a sultry tone than a seductive one on her verses, and while it works well in some places, it doesn\u2019t work well in others. The vocals and vocal layering on this song is not as good as the original track, as Taylor Swift\u2019s vocals sound better on the original than they do on this version, but regardless, both versions are very good pop songs. The chorus on this track is absolutely great, as Taylor shows off her vocal range while dropping some great lines and weighing the pros and cons of a new relationship (ultimately deciding to go for it). The two verses are good, but they\u2019re a little worse than they are on the original song, as the sultry vocal delivery Taylor Swift gives on them works well in some places but not as well in others. The bridge on this song (Taylor is known for her incredible bridges) is good as well, but the vocal layering was better on the original, as it made her voice sound more lush and full. The differences between this song and the original \u201cBlank Space\u201d from 1989 are pretty negligible overall, though, as both songs have good verses, a great chorus, and a very good bridge.\u201cStyle (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: HOW DID SHE ACTUALLY MAKE IT BETTER? It\u2019s a tough and very close race, but this song might be my favorite Taylor Swift song of all time. The song was already a 10, but Taylor Swift somehow managed to add more maturity, more depth, and more emotion to her lyrics and vocals on this song. The two verses are absolutely great, the chorus is amazing, and the bridge is impeccable. I\u2019m incredibly impressed that Taylor Swift took what was arguably her best song and made it better for this Taylor\u2019s Version. Excellent song.\u201cOut Of The Woods (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: Sounds basically the same as the original, but the backing vocals from Jack Antonoff are much more prominent on this track, as they\u2019re not just part of the beat, but his backing vocals help out Taylor Swift on the final chorus as well. Jack Antonoff doesn\u2019t have the best singing voice, and while his part is very short on the final chorus, I really wish he would\u2019ve just stuck to producing this song instead of trying to sing on it. The chorus from Taylor Swift on this song is awesome; she does an amazing job on this track and on the original with her chorus. The repetition of \u201cAre we out of the woods yet?\u201d & \u201cAre we in the clear yet?\u201d on the chorus gives the song a sense of hopeful anxiety that shows how Taylor feels about the relationship, as she thinks it won\u2019t work, but she hopes it will in the back of her mind. The two verses on this song are both very good, and surprisingly, the bridge is the weakest link of this song (not counting the beat, that is, as the shouting on the beat from producer Jack Antonoff got on my nerves on both the original track and this one). Taylor\u2019s lyrics and vocals on the verses are on point, as she gives snapshots into the relationship and its good times, but the bridge really comes out of left field, as she talks about ending up in a hospital with her boyfriend and mixes too many metaphors into one part. It\u2019s too confusing and I can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s talking about at that point in the song. Although it\u2019s slightly worse than the original, it\u2019s still a great song.\u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: I might not be remembering correctly, but I think this song is better than the original version as well, and the original version was already great. The chorus is absolutely excellent, the verses have great lyrics and vocals that metaphorically detail a relationship gone wrong by bad decisions made by Taylor\u2019s significant other, and the vocals are mature, collected, and show a sense of pity for Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend who left, especially on the chorus where she hits him with the titular line \u201cAll you had to do was stay,\u201d and follows it up with \u201cIt could\u2019ve been easy.\u201d I will definitely have to go back and relisten to the original 1989 album after listening to this Taylor\u2019s Version, but this track is absolutely amazing and I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t remember it very well because it\u2019s another 10 for T Swift. She\u2019s definitely on pace at the moment to secure the runner-up spot in 2023\u2019s AOTY race.\u201cShake It Off (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: This song is the first time on this album where a Taylor\u2019s Version song has been significantly better than the original track. The original \u201cShake It Off\u201d was a catchy song, but it could get annoying very quickly with Taylor Swift\u2019s halting, high-pitched vocal delivery, the overly repetitive and nuance-lacking chorus, the bridge that had elements of cringe in it, and the obnoxious trumpets on the instrumental. With this version, it seemed that Taylor listened to everything I didn\u2019t like about the original song and made a track that fixed those elements. The trumpets are extremely subdued on the instrumental; they\u2019re still there with the chords and occasional melodies, but they aren\u2019t in-your-face and loud like they were on the original. Taylor\u2019s vocals on the verses sound much more mature, smoother, and more emotional; as it sounds less like she\u2019s trying to make a radio-friendly pop song that will get a lot of airplay and more like she\u2019s trying to make a song that describes what people think about her vs. what she thinks about herself. The chorus is still repetitive and a bit mundane at times, but Taylor Swift\u2019s very good vocals on this song make it sound better and much more bearable. One of my favorite parts of this song was the vocal distortion used on Taylor\u2019s spoken interlude, which took it from campy cringe to a cool tone-shift for the song. The bridge was never my favorite because of the lyrics, but again, Taylor\u2019s vocals made it sound much better than it did on the original. The chorus is good at best, but the verses on here were great and the bridge was leaps and bounds better than it was on the original song. This track is a huge W for Taylor Swift and makes up for parts where tracks like \u201cBlank Space (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d may have fallen a bit short of their original counterparts.\u201cBad Blood (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO MAKE ANOTHER PERFECT 10 BETTER? This song is another one of my all-time favorite Taylor Swift songs, as well as its remix featuring Kendrick Lamar (which I\u2019m really excited to hear now after this song), but Taylor Swift\u2019s vocals on this song were absolutely incredible! The verses were amazing, as the vocals were evocative, the tone was more sultry and emotional on this song than in the original, and the lyrics were great. The chorus was awesome because the vocals weren\u2019t layered like on the original, which added authenticity to Taylor\u2019s voice. The synth arpeggio on the pre-chorus was also awesome, as that was a totally new production choice. I\u2019m glad Jack Antonoff put that in the song because it sounded great. The production on this version also has more of a boom bap hip-hop sound than the original, which actually helped Taylor more than the pop-focused production of the original. Such an amazing track, and now I can\u2019t wait to hear the new remix version with Kendrick Lamar.\u201cWildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: Taylor Swift cannot stop making her best album better. Another huge W on this version of \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d that sounds much more intimate, mature, elegant, and sophisticated than the version on the original 1989 album. That version sounds much more like a radio-friendly pop ballad, while this song sounds like that and then some. This track\u2019s instrumental has subdued yet lush synth chords that carry the melody, and Taylor Swift\u2019s vocals are absolutely great; this song might be the best she\u2019s ever sounded, and that\u2019s saying something because she\u2019s had some pretty great vocal performances across her career. The vocal layering on the final chorus is absolutely incredible, the verses are all great, and the maturity and elegance of Taylor Swift\u2019s vocals gives a smoothness to this track that is so much more authentic than the original song. Taylor Swift really sounds like Sade or Sabrina Carpenter on this song with how smooth her vocals are and how much emotion she poured into the track, especially with the chorus. Taylor Swift cannot stop taking W\u2019s on this album; she\u2019s really gunning for the #2 spot for albums in 2023.\u201cHow You Get The Girl (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: I\u2019ve gotta go back and relisten to the original version of this song because this track was absolutely incredible and I don\u2019t remember the original version from 1989 being as good as this one. The lyrics, subject matter, and playful vocals all appeal to me as a hopeless romantic and a lover of romantic movies & TV shows, so this track is a nearly perfect one for me. The chorus is absolutely amazing: Taylor Swift continues to deliver on her choruses, the first verse is great, and the second verse is good (only because of some awkward vocal delivery and some flow changes that messed Taylor up a little). The production from Jack Antonoff with its subdued synth chords mixed with pop country strings is the perfect juxtaposition of Taylor Swift\u2019s two eras of pure pop and pop country, and the lyrics on this song are just impeccable, as they\u2019re pretty much straight out of a rom com. Taylor Swift is undoubtedly going on a run with these great songs, but I can\u2019t say for certain that this track is better than the original version because I haven\u2019t heard \u201cHow You Get The Girl\u201d from 1989 in a while. It\u2019ll be a part of my OG 1989 re-review.\u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: Definitely an improvement from the original version, as it was more of a pop country ballad than this song is, as this track is more of a downtempo synthpop ballad that could fit right in on Midnights. The synth bassline from Jack Antonoff on the chorus is absolutely amazing, and the drums that kick in during the second verse are very well executed as well. Unfortunately, the song is still very sad and the lyrics aren\u2019t great, as they still sound sort of like a generic pop country ballad despite Taylor Swift\u2019s great vocal delivery and the excellent production from Jack Antonoff. The vocals from Taylor Swift are very good and Jack Antonoff makes this song simultaneously sound like a Depeche Mode song and a pop country ballad, which is very impressive, but the song is just too sad and the lyrics are incredibly mid. It\u2019s a near miss for Taylor and an overall W considering the original song.\u201cI Know Places (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: To quote my man DJ Khaled: \u201cANOTHA ONE.\u201d Taylor Swift did it again! She was able to make a perfect 10 song from 1989 even better on this album. The production from Jack Antonoff on this song is incredible, especially the drums he uses on the bridge, and the auto-tune employed on Taylor\u2019s voice for parts of this song is impeccable. Taylor Swift should use auto-tune more often in the capacity she used it on this song because she sounded great accompanied by it. The extended metaphor she uses on this song of everyone who didn\u2019t believe in her and in her relationship with a guy being \u201cthe hunters\u201d and her and her boyfriend being \u201cthe foxes\u201d actually works really well on this song, as Taylor doubles down on it every chance she gets, making it convincing throughout both of the great verses. The chorus is excellent as well, as Taylor Swift sounds like she\u2019s longing to be free and be with the guy she loves apart from everyone who didn\u2019t believe in her and the relationship. She does such a great job conveying those emotions in this chorus. To quote DJ Khaled again: \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe in us.\u201d For Taylor Swift on this song, \u201cThey are the hunters.\u201d It\u2019s another excellent track where Taylor Swift\u2019s mature, elegant, and sophisticated vocals come through for her and make the track sound more authentic and personable.\u201cClean (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: I\u2019m inclined to say this version is better than the original version, but I don\u2019t remember the original very well because I remember thinking it was a forgettable song, much like \u201cI Wish You Would\u201d on both this album and the original album. The production on this song is great, as the funky, reverb-heavy, subdued bassline sounds abrasive yet soothing at the same time, and the upbeat synth melody on the chorus goes really well with the bassline. The chorus is actually the worst part of this song, amazingly, as Taylor Swift does a great job with lyrics and vocals on the verses (the \u201cah-ah\u201d breaks between each line and rain metaphors are the highlights of the two verses), but the chorus has a weird flow and vocals that aren\u2019t as good as they were on the chorus. Taylor\u2019s voice sounds ethereal and uplifting on the non-lyric vocals for this song, and she continues to outdo herself by having vocals on this album that sound better than most of the songs in her discography. The chorus on this track isn\u2019t my favorite, but the verses are both great and the bridge is very good as well.\u201cWonderland (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: Pretty much sounds like the original song, but I don\u2019t remember the original track being as mid as this song is. Yet again, this album is showing me that I have to go back and relisten to the original 1989 album and conduct a re-review. The vocals and production on this song are very theatrical and gaudy, and Taylor Swift plays way too much into the Alice In Wonderland extended metaphor she\u2019s using to describe her relationship. I don\u2019t like Alice In Wonderland in any form, but even putting aside my dislike for that story, the melody on this song sounds childish and grating, the chords sound listless and formulaic, and the vocals from Taylor are either overly dramatic or not very nuanced. The pre-chorus is the best part of the song, but the chorus is too theatrical and kinda bad, and the verses are both average at best. It\u2019s a mid song, and I will definitely have to revisit the original track after hearing how weird and unlike Taylor Swift this song sounded.\u201cYou Are In Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: I wish Taylor Swift would do an entire album of songs like this one: elegant synthpop songs with lo-fi, laid-back, and low-key synth melodies and sultry, mellow vocals. She did some of these songs on her last album of totally new material Midnights in 2022 with \u201cQuestion\u2026?,\u201d \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d and even \u201cMaroon\u201d to some degree, but I\u2019d love to see Taylor Swift do an entire album of elegant pop songs with synthpop production. She could undoubtedly make the best album of her career if she tapped Timbaland & MIKE DEAN for production and got features from the GOATs of elegant pop Justin Timberlake, Sabrina Carpenter, Ariana Grande, and even Christina Aguilera to some degree. Now, back to this particular song: The synth melody and chord progression is laid-back, lo-fi, and mellow, but it\u2019s also lush and gives the feeling of rebirth and new love. The lyrics and vocals from Taylor are sultry, smooth, and romantic, which is exactly what I like to hear from her. The first verse is good but not great, but after the first chorus, which is great, Taylor Swift hits her stride and doesn\u2019t have a moment on the song that\u2019s not great. The lyrics, vocals, and production capture the feeling of being in love for the first time, and the vulnerability and emotion expressed by T Swift on this track is epic, especially when paired with the amazing synth melody from Jack Antonoff. Great song.\u201cNew Romantics (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: I remember this song being great on the original album, and it\u2019s just as great on this new version. There isn\u2019t any discernible difference between the two songs; at least not that I can tell, as they\u2019re both upbeat pop bangers where Taylor Swift talks about being young, single, and open to exploring opportunities and options. The song is about taking risks, falling and getting up, and not being afraid to put yourself out there, all of which are motivational topics that make this song the perfect outro for Taylor Swift\u2019s pure pop album 1989 (it\u2019s not the outro on Taylor\u2019s Version, but I can see why she made it the outro on the original album). The first verse is good at best, as Taylor\u2019s lyrics and vocal delivery aren\u2019t great on it, but the chorus is absolutely spectacular, and the second verse is amazing as well. Just like on the previous song, T Swift hits her stride on the chorus and doesn\u2019t look back. Yet another great track on this album.\u201c\"Slut!\u201d (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault)\u201c: Woah! A psychedelic, elegant, synthpop song from Taylor Swift? It\u2019s not at all what I expected this song to be, but I absolutely love it and this song will definitely go down as one of my all-time favorite Taylor Swift songs now. I\u2019ve wanted someone to attempt psychedelic elegant synthpop for some time now, as the genres of psychedelia, elegant pop, and synthpop are three of my favorite genres of all time, but though artists I love have done two out of the three before, no one I\u2019ve heard has ever done all three simultaneously. Taylor Swift did that with this song. Her vivid and colorful lyrics coupled with her sultry and breathy vocals made the verses absolutely amazing, and the chorus' trippy and spacey vocals and synth production was epic as well. The production on this song sounded like Taylor Swift\u2019s Midnights meets Justin Timberlake\u2019s The 20/20 Experience with a touch of psychedelia added to it, and I\u2019ve gotta say, it was awesome. I\u2019m absolutely blown away by how great this song is.\u201cSay Don\u2019t Go (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault)\u201d: This song is a bit on the campier side and isn\u2019t anything groundbreaking, but it\u2019s a solid track. The verses are good, the chorus is good and has a bit of Taylor Swift\u2019s transitional pop-country-to-pure-pop vocal delivery on it, and while the production is somewhat basic and bland, it gets the job done. The song is about Taylor Swift wanting to be in a relationship with a guy, but she wants him more than he wants her, leading to Taylor realizing she\u2019s more committed to the relationship than he is. She wants him to want her, but he doesn\u2019t pick up on the signs. The lyrics aren\u2019t some of Taylor\u2019s most groundbreaking or memorable, but her vocals are good and the track overall is a solidly moving breakup song. A good track to pad the stats of this album and solidify a second W for the From The Vault tracks.\u201cSuburban Legends (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault)\u201d: I want to like this song because of its upbeat synthpop production and subject matter that shows Taylor fantasizing about reuniting with a high school crush and showing up at a high school reunion with them as her date (it\u2019s a fantasy that\u2019s extremely relatable that I\u2019ve had many times) (Drake also mentions it in his music multiple times), but it\u2019s very bland, basic, and unoriginal. The vocal delivery is very passive and Taylor sounds like she\u2019s going through the motions on the verses, and the lyrics aren\u2019t particularly good either. The chorus is undoubtedly the best part of the song, as it stands out as a good thing amidst mid verses, but it\u2019s not one of Taylor\u2019s best choruses by any means. The production has the upbeat synthpop sound, but the arpeggios sound tired and overdone after a while. This song also sounds very similar to the previous mid track \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault),\u201d where Taylor Swift takes multiple L\u2019s including dissing the genre of acid rock (another name for psychedelic rock with hard guitars). Taylor is now 2-2 on the From The Vault section of the album.\u201cIs It Over Now? (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From The Vault)\u201d: 3-2 is definitely the best record Taylor Swift has ever had for a From The Vault section of one of her Taylor\u2019s Version albums. I was a bit disappointed initially that she didn\u2019t get any featured artists for her From The Vault songs, but at this point, I don\u2019t think she needed any. This song is an amazing track that details infidelity from Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend and basically airs out his dirty laundry while also expressing her own pain about the breakup. This song is a brilliant look at infidelity in a relationship and how Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend felt at the beginning of the relationship and how he felt when he was searching for something that was seemingly greater, as Taylor eloquently explains it. The chorus is actually the weakest part of the song here; it\u2019s good, but the verses are great and steal the show for this track. The lush, happy, upbeat synth production acts as a brilliant juxtaposition for Taylor\u2019s biting and acerbic lyricism on this song, and it\u2019s a great choice, especially for a closing song to the From The Vault section. Great track.\u201cBad Blood (Remix) (feat. Kendrick Lamar) (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d: This song is absolutely awesome. The original version that\u2019s a collaboration between Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar, two generation-defining artists that have reached mythic, superstar status in music at this point is already an amazing song that showed off both artists' superpower in the industry, but this song shows the maturity that both artists have developed over the years since their first collaboration on the original version. The song definitely sounds different, as there are EDM 808 chords on the chorus and a few other wonky sounding synths throughout the verses, but it\u2019s a great production choice that speaks to the evolution of both artists while being fire. The fame Taylor & Kendrick have achieved has only grown since their first collab, so seeing them come back together after branching out and making albums that have defined their respective genres and music as a whole is a true full-circle moment. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers vocal delivery and flow comes out on this song, and while he tries to stay true to his original verse, he provides more nuance on this version with his vocal delivery, backing vocals, and flow switches. Taylor sounds pretty much the same as she did on \u201cBad Blood (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d which is an improvement to the original. I\u2019m so touched to see Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar reuniting on this song, and it really makes me wish Taylor would work with more hip-hop artists, specifically Kendrick.Well, the verdict is not quite out yet, but let me go ahead and say that this album is the best pop album of 2023 (as of its release and this review\u2019s publication on Nov. 6, 2023), the second best album of 2023 (falling behind only Travis Scott\u2019s UTOPIA, which is one of the greatest albums ever made), and the best Taylor Swift album. I\u2019ve been saying it for a while, but I\u2019ll reiterate: 1989 is my favorite Taylor Swift album. It\u2019s her best and most thorough pop album she\u2019s ever released, and it\u2019s the album that not only pushed her into the mainstream but also suited her musical style the best. Now, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) has officially turned me into a Swiftie. Not to date this review, but I may have to go out and buy a Travis Kelce jersey and start cheering for the Kansas City Chiefs on account of Taylor\u2019s current boyfriend. Considering that my favorite artist of all time Drake dropped one of the worst albums of 2023 and the most embarrassing album in his long and storied career of dropping good music earlier in October, Taylor Swift came in and said \u201cI gotchu covered\u201d with this banger of an album. There are still songs I don\u2019t like regardless of the re-recording, like the campy and kiddie \u201cWelcome To New York (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and other mid songs like \u201cI Wish You Would (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d & \u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d but all of my re-recorded favorites either sounded the same or better, and some of the songs I either slept on or didn\u2019t remember were bangers. \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d & \u201cWildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d really came out of left field as dark horse 10s, and \u201cShake It Off (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d & \u201cYou Are In Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d were extremely good re-recordings that blew the originals out of the water. It\u2019s always good to see Kendrick Lamar on a tracklist, and I\u2019ve gotta say I\u2019m glad he linked up with Taylor Swift for a re-recording of the remix to her smash hit \u201cBad Blood.\u201d The From The Vault tracks went 3-2, which is over .500 and better than any other From The Vault section of a Taylor\u2019s Version album. Overall, Taylor Swift took a W with her From The Vault tracks despite not recruiting any featured artists. To have a 22-track album where there are more 10s than misses is extraordinarily impressive, and I\u2019m glad to say Taylor Swift did it with a re-recording of my favorite album of hers that proved to be better than the original.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 26, 2023Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Trap, Pop Rap, Dirty SouthTracks:Act Up (feat.

Jon Batiste)\u201d: Full disclosure before I comment about this song: I\u2019m doing this review about a month too late, as this album was released in September 2023 and I\u2019m doing this review at the end of October 2023. I really wanted to listen to this album earlier since it\u2019s one of my all-time favorite rappers Lil Wayne doing it, but extenuating circumstances happened. Now, anyway, back to commenting on the song. The production from STREETRUNNER & Jon Batiste on this song is majestic; the soft grand piano melody and lush synth chords that accompany it are absolutely awesome. Lil Wayne\u2019s first verse of melodic auto-tuned rapping over this incredible grand piano melody was so well done that I was disappointed when the drums kicked in. The drums were a bit off to begin with, but eventually they meshed well with the melody and Lil Wayne used both of them to his advantage. The first verse from Lil Wayne was the best one, and his chorus was great as well, but his second verse was only good because of a few weird and \u201csus\u201d lines that were a bit out-of-pocket. Gospel & R&B singer Jon Batiste (the best artist comparison I have for him is PJ Morton, as they both are multi-instrumentalists who make gospel R&B albums stacked with features) provides backing vocals on the intro and production for this song, and he does a great job with both. His piano melody and the backing vocals were perfect complements to Lil Wayne on this song. Even though this album is only a mixtape preceding Lil Wayne\u2019s long-anticipated Tha Carter VI, this track sounds like a grandiose intro to what will be a banger album. I just wish Jon Batiste had contributed a verse or part of the chorus.\u201cBirds\u201d: After that banger intro, we have one of Lil Wayne\u2019s worst songs of all time and one of the worst songs of 2023. First of all, we have a \u201cgoofy aah,\u201d \u201csilly aah,\u201d \u201cKidz Bop aah\u201d beat from Murda Beatz that has the most generic trap drums ever mixed with computerized bird chirping noises. I mean, there\u2019s no way Murda Beatz made this beat and was serious about it. It\u2019s gotta be down there with the worst beats I\u2019ve ever heard. Who thought this was a good idea? I\u2019m convinced Murda Beatz has a losing record for good vs. bad beats now. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s the same guy who produced Drake\u2019s \u201cPortland (feat. Quavo & Travis Scott).\u201d This beat is seriously garbage in every way it can be. Second of all, the lyrics from Lil Wayne are absolutely horrendous. The metaphors sound like stuff I\u2019d expect Lil Pump to say in one of his ridiculous and stupid verses, and the lyrics themselves are not saying anything of value. The lyrics are repetitive, cringy, and just plain dumb. Third of all, Lil Wayne has probably one of the worst moments in the history of his career when he tries to sing the chorus in a Southern accent and auto-tune. He sounds like Walker Hayes, the guy behind the abomination \u201cFancy Like\u201d (a.k.a. hip-hop country song from the Applebee\u2019s commercials), on that chorus, and it\u2019s abysmal. This track is complete and utter trash. What a terrible L on track 2 for Lil Wayne. I\u2019m hoping Tha Carter VI sounds nothing like this song.\u201cSlip\u201d: That chorus is CRINGE with a capital C. I can not believe Lil Wayne wrote that chorus, recorded it, and said \u201cyeah, this chorus sounds like a banger, let\u2019s drop it.\u201d It\u2019s not as bad as the chorus from \u201cBirds,\u201d the previous song, but then again, not much I\u2019ve heard is worse than that. The chorus is extremely repetitive and disgusting lyrically, which makes it a chore to listen to. The first verse is pretty mid, as Lil Wayne comes out the gate with the line \u201cI ain\u2019t talkin' s***, I\u2019m gargling the toilet water,\u201d which is an extremely cringe statement and a pretty terrible metaphor overall, but the second verse is horrendous, as Lil Wayne basically raps in a high-pitched falsetto while talking about some extremely \u201csus\u201d and out of pocket things that no one wanted to hear from him. The third verse, however, is great. The flows are on point, the lyrics are mostly good, and the delivery was dark and menacing, which went along well with the fire beat from TheNightAftr. The production from TheNightAftr was really good on this song, especially the grand piano riff and the drums that sounded kind of like Drake\u2019s \u201cSuccessful (feat. Lil Wayne & Trey Songz).\u201d Overall, Lil Wayne couldn\u2019t get it done, but if the whole song was that third verse, the track would be at least a 9.\u201cKat Food\u201d: An extremely vulgar strip club anthem about multiple different women\u2019s vaginas where every other line is basically a metaphor involving sex or blowjobs, but\u2026 it\u2019s kinda fire. The main problem I have with this song is its subject matter and lyrics. The production from FNZ & Charlie Handsome is unorthodox and a bit unconventional (the beeping synth arpeggios and 808 slides are a bit insane, but they go hard), but it\u2019s really good, and while Lil Wayne\u2019s lyrics and subject matter can be very vulgar and pretty gross for a lot of the song, some of the metaphors are really good and Lil Wayne nails the vocal delivery and flows on this song. The chorus, especially the part where he says \u201cCat hangin' out that catsuit, ooh, Serena,\u201d is vulgar, but it\u2019s fire. I\u2019m not sure who Weezy was talking about when he said \u201cSerena,\u201d but whether it was professional tennis player Serena Williams or Blake Lively\u2019s Gossip Girl character Serena van der Woodsen, he made it sound like a hot girl. The line in the second verse \u201cA$$, p****, boobs, APB, yeah, I\u2019m lookin' for \u2018em\u201d was actually really good as well. While the subject matter of this song is undesirable and the track was clearly made to be a strip club anthem, Lil Wayne does his thing on here and makes a good song.\u201cTuxedo (feat. Euro)\u201d: This track sounds like a rejected song from Lil Wayne\u2019s 2010 album Rebirth, which was his attempt at rock and pop punk assisted by guys like Kevin Rudolf and Travis Barker (who is currently leading the charge on the emo pop punk revival currently in 2023). The production sounds straight out of Travis Barker\u2019s playbook, as this beat sounds like it was intended for blink-182, The Killers, Green Day, or even the dumb bargain-brand version of The Killers The Click Five. The production is terrible, needless to say, as it\u2019s emo pop punk with trap drums, and Lil Wayne falls into his old patterns from Rebirth, as he tries to sing the chorus in a whiny emo voice and gives a bad verse to accompany it. Euro did a pretty good job with his verse on this song, as his lyrics were good, his vocal delivery was solid, and his flows sounded somewhat like Fivio Foreign, but there was only so much he could do with this trash beat and Lil Wayne giving him no support. Weezy, I beg you, man: stop making emo pop punk rock music. With seemingly everyone in pop music doing it now, it sounds worse than it ever has, and it sounded terrible before.\u201cChanel No. 5 (feat. Foushe\u00e9)\u201d: Julian Munro & Manny Galvez should never be allowed to produce for Lil Wayne again (or anyone, for that matter). First, they produced the Travis Barker type beat on \u201cTuxedo (feat. Euro),\u201d and now, they\u2019ve produced this beat on here, which is literally five low octave notes played on the grand piano with as little nuance as possible coupled with some generic trap drums. The piano melody somehow has less nuance than \u201cSuge\u201d by DaBaby or \u201cTell The Vision (feat. Pop Smoke)\u201d by Kanye West. The beat is garbage, and Foushe\u00e9 needs to stick to singing. She rapped the second verse on this song after singing the bridge, and it was like night and day. Foushe\u00e9 is a good singer, 2023 has definitely been a breakout year for her on choruses, but she absolutely sucks as a rapper. Lil Wayne\u2019s first verse and chorus were both bad, but she somehow managed to be worse with her verse. Lyrics, vocals, and flow were all terrible on Foushe\u00e9\u2019s verse. Terrible song; get Julian Munro & Manny Galvez out of the studio.\u201cNo New B****es (feat. Wheezy & Young Thug)\u201d: A collaboration between Weezy and Wheezy was something that was long overdue, so I\u2019m glad it happened. Although I was disappointed Young Thug didn\u2019t get a verse on this song, he went absolutely crazy on the backing vocals for this song; it\u2019s probably the best part of the track. The production from Wheezy has its ups and downs; the Young Thug backing vocals are great and the drum pattern is awesome as well, but the slot machine sounds on the chorus were unnecessary and pretty weird. The worst part of this song is undoubtedly Lil Wayne\u2019s lyrics and subject matter, though. Just like \u201cKat Food,\u201d the entire track is about a woman\u2019s vagina and every line refers to sex or blowjobs, but unlike \u201cKat Food,\u201d Lil Wayne does nothing with this subject matter except give trash bars on bad verses. Although he recruited Wheezy & Thugger for this song, Weezy just ended up making another trash track.\u201cTity Boi (feat. TheNightAftr)\u201d: First of all, if you\u2019re gonna make a song called Tity Boi, it needs to feature the guy who had that as his rap name before he rebranded: 2 Chainz. Seriously, Lil Wayne made Collegrove with 2 Chainz, a pretty great collab album, so it\u2019s the least he could do to feature him on a song featuring his name. Second of all, Lil Wayne should not be doing Jersey Club. Lil Uzi Vert & Bad Bunny might\u2019ve tried their hands at the genre in 2022, and \u201cJust Wanna Rock\u201d by Lil Uzi Vert is insanely fire, but Lil Wayne has never been Lil Uzi Vert. Their song \u201cMultiple Flows (with Lil Uzi Vert)\u201d from Weezy\u2019s Funeral album was fire, but why does Lil Wayne think he needs to hop on this trend (way too late, I might add)? It\u2019s like Drake doing rage beats and Playboi Carti flows on his For All The Dogs album. Why do these guys, both legends who have cemented themselves and their styles, feel the need to do new stuff to stay current? That\u2019s not what their fans want from them. Anyway, this song isn\u2019t even good Jersey Club. TheNightAftr\u2019s production on here is all over the place. The first two minutes of the song sound like what would happen if Tchaikovsky\u2019s The Nutcracker was produced by Afrojack or Avicii, and once the drums kicked in, the same boring orchestral-sounding synths continued and Lil Wayne still tried to mold his flow to match them, which was extremely cringe. Lyrics sucked, vocals sucked, and pretty much everything about this song was a total L.\u201cGood Morning\u201d: Not too much to say about this song except for that it\u2019s the theme song to Skip Bayless & Shannon Sharpe\u2019s ESPN show Undisputed, and it makes that fact abundantly clear with the bars. The song is extremely forced and reminds me of Eminem\u2019s song \u201cVenom\u201d from the Venom movie, which had a similar forced aspect to it. That song was a lot worse and sounded more forced than this one does, but it\u2019s relatively the same concept. This track sounds like Lil Wayne trying to make the theme song for a kids' TV show.Tha Fix Before Tha VI is meant to be the prelude to Lil Wayne\u2019s next album Tha Carter VI, an album with unfathomable hype. Tha Carter V, originally slated to be released in 2013 as the follow-up to Lil Wayne\u2019s 2011 album Tha Carter IV, got caught up in a legal battle which postponed the release of that album until 2018 (and of its subsequent deluxe edition until 2020). Tha Carter VI\u2019s hype has been building ever since Young Thug released his debut album Barter 6 in 2015 as a tribute to Lil Wayne and the longstanding legal battle between him and his record label. Now, it seems Tha Carter VI\u2019s release is imminent, and Lil Wayne is teasing it with this album. I\u2019ve gotta say, there\u2019s only one song on this album that I\u2019d want to see on Tha Carter VI, and that\u2019s \u201cAct Up (feat. Jon Batiste),\u201d as Lil Wayne glides gracefully in melodic auto-tuned over an elegant grand piano melody that turns into a banger with a fast-paced drum pattern. The production from STREETRUNNER & Jon Batiste on that track shows how great Lil Wayne can be when he\u2019s going hard on a great beat. Now, as for the rest of this album, I\u2019m glad Lil Wayne released this stuff now because I don\u2019t want to hear any of it on Tha Carter VI. A \u201cgoofy aah\u201d Murda Beatz instrumental with computerized bird chirping? A relapse into emo pop punk rock? A Jersey Club beat? None of these things spell greatness for Lil Wayne. This album is bad, and while the intro track was pretty epic and indicative of what Lil Wayne is capable of producing, the rest of this album sounded like garbage. \u201cKat Food\u201d was a triumphant song that made me realize how much Lil Wayne can do with crap subject matter, but other tracks on this album made me wonder what the heck Weezy was thinking. The lyrics on this album were extremely hit or miss, and more miss than hit for pretty much the entire album. The flows were the same way, but it would be feast or famine with them. Either Lil Wayne would flow amazingly or completely off the beat; there was no in between. Production on this album was also very inconsistent, to the extent that the same producers would make a good beat on one song and a bad one later on the album. Overall, this album is a jumbled mess that shows Lil Wayne in a very similar place as Drake on his 2023 album For All The Dogs: Trying too many new things and attempting to jump on trends as opposed to making the kind of music he\u2019s always been good at making.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released October 6, 2023Genres: Art Rock, Jazz, Emo, Country, Indie (Singer-Songwriter)Tracks:Breathe \u2013 1.2On The Run \u2013 0.1Time \u2013 0.4Great Gig In The Sky \u2013 3Money \u2013 0.1Us And Them \u2013 2.6Any Colour You Like \u2013 1.4Brain Damage \u2013 0.1Eclipse \u2013 2.4[Spoken interlude \u201cSpeak To Me\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cBreathe\u201d: You gotta be kidding me. I figured that a version of Pink Floyd\u2019s 1973 classic album The Dark Side Of The Moon re-recorded and re-released by an 80-year-old Roger Waters with the sole purpose of \u201csetting the record straight\u201d that he \u201cwas the one who wrote The Dark Side Of The Moon\u201d (while simultaneously claiming that guitarist and singer David Gilmour, keyboardist Richard Wright, and Nick Mason were \u201cnot artists\u201d) would be bad, but I had no idea it would be this bad. The instrumental on this song sounds like an indie rock band with terrible mixing, an organ, and an acoustic guitar attempting to make a minimalist version of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cBreathe (In The Air)\u201d for the score of a horror movie. Although, the beat sounds more like it could be used in a Spirit Halloween commercial. The vocals on this song are laughably awful, as Roger Waters simultaneously sounds like he\u2019s on his deathbed and sounds like he\u2019s trying to make a parody of the original song. Roger Waters sounds like Doug Walker (aka The Nostalgia Critic) if he was a disgruntled old man who hadn\u2019t outgrown his emo phase. The lyrics that aren\u2019t Pink Floyd\u2019s original lyrics are terrible, as Roger Waters drops some trash spoken word at the beginning of the song that sounds abysmally bad and incredibly nihilistic. To be honest, this track sounds like an indie rock band trying to do a horror movie score mixed with an 80-year-old emo guy parodying Pink Floyd. This track is definitely down there with Nostalgia Critic\u2019s The Wall as being one of the worst imitations of Pink Floyd out there.\u201cOn The Run\u201d: Roger Waters rambles incoherently about some jumbled emo nonsense that sounds like it was taken from a 15-year-old wannabe poet emo kid\u2019s diary over a \u201cgoofy aah,\u201d \u201cCharlie Chaplin aah\u201d piano melody that sounds like it\u2019s supposed to be the score for a black-and-white movie or a Looney Tunes cartoon. An instant skip.\u201cTime\u201d: I was halfway joking when I said Roger Waters was like Doug Walker (The Nostalgia Critic) on the first song, but after hearing this track, it\u2019s not even a joke anymore. Roger Waters is an 80-year-old emo guy who\u2019s essentially parodying The Dark Side Of The Moon in the same way that Doug Walker parodied The Wall with Nostalgia Critic\u2019s The Wall. Some more stupid spoken word nihilistic and emo poetry happens at the beginning of the song, then the track lazily transitions into Roger Waters sounding like he\u2019s on his deathbed again and essentially talking through the verses. His vocal range on this album so far sounds like it\u2019s 0 octaves because he\u2019s not even trying to sing. He\u2019s just talking, and it makes the track sound almost like a country song. \u201cTime\u201d is already a lot less awesome without David Gilmour\u2019s vocals and brilliant guitar solo, but when it\u2019s replaced with a tepid and lazy attempt at an organ solo and Roger Waters' bland spoken vocals, it sounds absolutely awful. I can\u2019t believe how bad this song is.\u201cGreat Gig In The Sky\u201d: Another mess of a song where Roger Waters rambles on about nonsensical garbage for the majority of the track, but the one thing about this song that\u2019s mildly okay is the non-lyric vocals in the style of the original singer of \u201cThe Great Gig In The Sky (feat. Clare Torry)\u201d: Clare Torry. The non-lyric vocals follow the same note progression that hers do, but they\u2019re done in the style of Depeche Mode\u2019s Dave Gahan, as they\u2019re sung (probably not by Roger Waters or by Roger Waters in heavy auto-tune) in a low, deep vocal register that sounds like it\u2019s intended for the dark and somewhat foreboding synthpop sounds of Depeche Mode. Unfortunately, that part of the song is only mildly interesting and it\u2019s not executed extremely well. The subtle drums that accompany these vocals are cool, but they don\u2019t really stand out or make any contribution. It\u2019s another track that\u2019s just a hapless and directionless imitation of the original song.\u201cMoney\u201d: Absolute and complete garbage in every sense of the word. This song sounds as if someone (i.e. Roger Waters) took everything that was good about Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cMoney\u201d out of the song, stripped it down to its absolute bare bones, then proceeded to put the most lifeless, uninspired, hapless, lazy, and boring instrumental and vocals on it. Again, 80-year-old Roger Waters sounds like he\u2019s on his deathbed while talking through the verses on this song on an instrumental that does nothing except recreate the 7/4 time signature of the original song. The bass guitar used on this track sounds like it\u2019s from an indie rock band with crappy mixing and a bad bassist. Roger Waters' vocals sound like a country music vocalist again, and he proceeds to absolutely ruin the original song with his stupidly awful poetry yet again. A complete and utter betrayal of how the original track sounded that\u2019s more like a parody than the original song.\u201cUs And Them\u201d: The original song \u201cUs And Them\u201d by Pink Floyd is definitely one of the more underrated great songs from The Dark Side Of The Moon, and at the very least, Roger Waters spares the pretentious, emo, \u201cgoofy aah,\u201d wannabe nihilistic poetry on this song, but it\u2019s still a half-baked, watered-down, pathetic attempt at a recreation of another great song. The instrumental is extremely boring, as it sounds like one of Rob Scallion\u2019s trash Pink Floyd recreations for Nostalgia Critic\u2019s The Wall mixed with jazz influences. The vocals and flow from Roger Waters on this song is no different than it has been on any of the other tracks; he sounds like an old man on his deathbed talking though the lyrics of this song. When he attempts to sing or use vocal effects, the vocal effects only exacerbate how bad he already sounds. This song is complete and total garbage in every sense, but it\u2019s at least a more faithful recreation than some of the other pieces of crap on this album.\u201cAny Colour You Like\u201d: The laid-back, low-key, downtempo, jazzy instrumental on this track is actually pretty good, but everything else about the song is abhorrently bad. The instrumental isn\u2019t mixed very well despite it having a nice arrangement, and Roger Waters continues with his deranged, emo, nihilistic psychobabble on this song. He starts by talking about atoms under an electron microscope (the man obviously doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s impossible to see atoms under an electron microscope) and ends by naming colors for no reason. This track is yet another that sounds like it\u2019s a parody of Pink Floyd\u2019s music and that Roger Waters is making a mockery of the album he claims to have been the architect behind.\u201cBrain Damage\u201d: I couldn\u2019t last 30 seconds into this song. This track is already my least favorite from Pink Floyd\u2019s The Dark Side Of The Moon; although it\u2019s good, it\u2019s not my favorite, but Roger Waters turned it into a country song with his cringy old man spoken word vocal delivery and attempted Southern American accent (the dude is British, but I guess he\u2019s trying his best to break into the country music market, I don\u2019t know). The first lines of the song are \u201cWhat if we re-recorded The Dark Side Of The Moon? / (Roger Waters laughs hysterically) He\u2019s gone mad.\u201d It\u2019s as if Roger Waters is aware of how terrible an idea this album was and how absolutely garbage it sounds, but he was still okay with doing it and thought \u201cyeah, whatever, it might sound bad, but at least I\u2019ll get to prove I\u2019m the best Pink Floyd member.\u201d It\u2019s all about ego with this guy. He\u2019s okay with ruining a classic great album because he doesn\u2019t care about Pink Floyd\u2019s legacy; only his own. It\u2019s almost a worse angle than Doug Walker (The Nostalgia Critic) had with his parody album of Pink Floyd\u2019s The Wall. So garbage.\u201cEclipse\u201d: Very boring. The instrumental on this song is an extremely watered-down, stripped-down, half-baked, pathetic version of the original Pink Floyd song \u201cEclipse,\u201d as it\u2019s very minimalist and tries too hard to capture a foreboding atmosphere, and the instrumentation is lackluster and sloppy. The vocals from Roger Waters are spoken again, and they sound ridiculously awful, and although the backing vocals are sung in auto-tune and with vocal effects and sound somewhat good, they\u2019re so much worse than the original song and so out-of-place next to the Roger Waters spoken word vocal cadence that it\u2019s not even funny. Again, this track sounds like a bad parody of the original song from The Dark Side Of The Moon. A terrible ending to a terrible album.Roger Waters. The bassist and songwriter of Pink Floyd from the group\u2019s formation in 1965 to 1985. He has a long history of being an insufferable douchebag, and this album is just another example of him being a prick. From after the release of Pink Floyd\u2019s 1979 album The Wall until now, Roger Waters has not shut up about how he\u2019s \u201cthe best Pink Floyd member,\u201d \u201cthe only good Pink Floyd member,\u201d and \u201cthe only real artist in the group.\u201d To be honest, I never thought he was that good of an artist. His songwriting is good, as The Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here work really well as concept albums, but it\u2019s not that good, as The Wall is a jumbled and disjointed mess. He\u2019s a good bassist, but David Gilmour absolutely waxes him on vocals and outshines Roger Waters' bass parts with his guitar parts on pretty much every song (maybe with the exception of \u201cMoney\u201d). Even on \u201cOne Of These Days\u201d by Pink Floyd where Roger Waters & David Gilmour both play bass, David Gilmour is the better bass player. In short, David Gilmour is the best Pink Floyd member, and Roger Waters is probably the worst one (he\u2019s definitely the most annoying). Recently, Roger Waters was exposed for being an anti-Semite, as he wore the Swastika on his coat at a show in Berlin where he was performing The Wall earlier this year, and honestly, it\u2019s a long time coming because Roger Waters wrote The Wall about himself, and it\u2019s an anti-Semitic album (at least, the latter quarter of it is). However, this album is truly a testament to how big of a prick Roger Waters is and how bad of an artist he is. It\u2019s also a testament to his ego, which is probably one of the biggest ones I\u2019ve ever seen. Sometimes, a big ego is necessary for a great artist, but when a mediocre artist who\u2019s 80 years old and degrades artists better than him with his comments has an ego that\u2019s inflated as much as Roger Waters' is, it\u2019s a big problem. The Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd is a great album. 9.5 score on the page, and that\u2019s not changing anytime soon. This album takes everything that was good about Dark Side, removes it, keeping only the lyrics and parts of the instrumentals, and replaces it with flavorless, tepid, and self-important spoken word vocals by an 80-year-old Roger Waters who sounds like he\u2019s on his deathbed alongside instrumentals that sound like they were done by an indie rock band trying to do a horror movie score with jazz influences and crappy mixing. To add to that, Roger Waters also brings out spoken interludes on these songs that are emo, \u201cedgy,\u201d nihilistic, and fake-depressed psychobabble where Roger Waters rambles incoherently about nothing. This album is Nostalgia Critic\u2019s The Wall, essentially, but it was done as a serious album by a former Pink Floyd member trying to prove he could do it better than the group did it as an 80-year-old man talking on indie jazz rock instrumentals. Probably one of the most pretentious and least self-aware albums in the history of music.

There was a time when Drake was undefeated on his intro tracks, but ever since DARK LANE DEMO TAPES opened with \u201cDeep Pockets,\u201d Drake has failed to deliver on one of the main things that\u2019s made his albums so great in the past: His ability to start them off strong. The production from legendary Drake producer 40, which includes a pitched-up Frank Ocean sample, is mid, as it includes a basic, contrived, and hollow trap drum pattern and pitched-up Frank Ocean vocals that are mixed poorly. Drake sings on the choruses, and his singing sounds like it did on Honestly, Nevermind. The auto-tune use is bad, Drake sounds pitchy and can\u2019t hit notes, and his vocals are straight up not good. The first verse is below average, as Drake has a good flow, but his lyrics are mid at best and he drops some cringy lines. The second verse is bad, as Drake consistently drops bad lyrics and terrible attempts at quotables while flowing awkwardly over this mid beat from 40. There\u2019s not too much to say about this Drake intro track except that it\u2019s not good. This album starts off with bad filler that was likely a reject from Honestly, Nevermind.\u201cAmen (feat. Teezo Touchdown)\u201d: After Drake co-signed Teezo Touchdown\u2019s debut album How Do You Sleep At Night? by calling it \u201csome of the best music [he\u2019s] ever heard\u201d (when it was absolute trash in reality and probably one of the worst albums of 2023), I expected that he would show up on this album, especially after going on a run in 2023 and getting features from Don Toliver & Travis Scott on their 2023 albums. Teezo Touchdown wasn\u2019t too bad on this track, especially considering how absolutely abhorrent he was on the majority of How Do You Sleep At Night?. His vocals on the chorus are a little better than average, and the one-man choir effect used for his ad-libs is very cool. The chorus he does is heavily inspired by gospel and has an overall gospel sound, but it\u2019s overly repetitive and has a cringy concept behind it. Teezo Touchdown is singing on the chorus about a girl who is \u201cpraying that [she\u2019ll] find a man (amen) who can treat [her] like [he] can,\u201d and Drake continues that concept into his verse, which is vapid, bland, and overall flavorless. Drake raps in a half-baked, phoned-in, and trite flow where he raps about getting kicked to the curb after being better for the girl than her ex-boyfriend was. Drake has sounded whiny, moody, and overly dramatic on these first two tracks, and I fear his demeanor on these songs doesn\u2019t bode well for the rest of the album. The production from Teezo Touchdown had a piano melody that was campy, corny, and reminiscent of most of the trash beats on How Do You Sleep At Night?. Teezo Touchdown was average on this song, but he still outperformed Drake, who had a mid verse. Another bad song.\u201cCalling For You (feat. 21 Savage)\u201d: I don\u2019t even know where to begin with how absolutely horrendous this song is. For starters, this song (as of right now, this album might have some worse ones) is the worst Drake song of all time. The production from Lil Yachty & 40 contains a badly mixed and poorly executed sample of \u201cCalling 4 You (Freestyle)\u201d by Fridayy which was mixed with a pseudo-rage / pseudo-drill instrumental with booming and extremely boosted 808 bass and raucous drums in a drill drum pattern. The chorus was supposed to be a sample of \u201cCalling 4 You (Freestyle)\u201d by Fridayy, but I couldn\u2019t hardly hear him between the terrible mixing of the vocals, the increased pitch, and the ridiculously loud 808 bassline. The first verse from Drake was absolutely awful, as it was overly repetitive, had high-pitched and squeaky vocals, and had a flow and vocal cadence that mimicked Destroy Lonely or Playboi Carti. Drake tried to do a Playboi Carti flow on the 21 Savage collab album Her Loss with his solo song \u201cJumbotron S*** Poppin,\u201d and it didn\u2019t work at all, but this verse was even worse than that song. In between Drake\u2019s first verse and 21 Savage\u2019s second verse (with the Fridayy sample in between them), there was a sampled spoken interlude that was a random person\u2019s Twitter rant about ridiculously stupid things like travel plans and dinner plans with their significant other that made no sense and took up two whole minutes of the song. What was Drake thinking when he put that on the song? It contributed absolutely nothing and served only to decrease my expectations for the rest of the song. 21 Savage\u2019s second verse didn\u2019t deliver at all, as the lyrics were horrifically bad, the flow was terrible and didn\u2019t work at all with the beat, and some of the lines he dropped were some of the worst of his entire career, and he\u2019s had some really bad ones over time. I debated about this song being worse than Drake\u2019s terrible British drill song \u201cWar,\u201d but that horrific spoken interlude pushed it over the edge. What an awful song.\u201cFear Of Heights\u201d: The rage production from OZ, BNYX\u00ae, Nik D, and Pooh Beatz (a very eclectic mix of producers from all areas of hip-hop) is good, as this beat has strong drums and a solid 808 bassline pattern, but the verses from Drake on this song are absolutely cringe. The first verse from Drake (which was over a different beat, a minimalist, slow, and downtempo instrumental) is bad because Drake\u2019s flow is phoned-in and his lyrics are horrendously awful (he basically berates an ex-girlfriend and airs her dirty laundry in an extremely petty manner), and the second verse from Drake is mid at best, as he goes on a heater for a few lines after the cringy chorus where he copies Playboi Carti and imitates his high-pitched, halting, and choppy vocal delivery, but after that, he starts copying Playboi Carti\u2019s flow again and does the high-pitched, halting, and choppy vocal delivery again. There is no reason why Drake should be trying to do the Playboi Carti flow! Absolutely none! It\u2019s ridiculous for an artist as popular, versatile, and established as Drake to be copying such an inferior artist as Playboi Carti, but here we are. Drake is on track for making his worst album of all time with these stupidly awful songs.\u201cDaylight (feat. Adonis Graham)\u201d: The rage production from Southside on this song was definitely the best rage beat on this album so far, as the synth melody is great, the drum pattern is great, and the 808 bassline was booming and hard-hitting. Southside was incredibly impressive with the rage production on this track, especially considering his background producing trap beats. However, Drake underperformed yet again on this song, as he copied Playboi Carti\u2019s flow again for two verses and an insanely repetitive chorus. The lyrics are abysmally bad on this song, the two verses from Drake are uninventive, uninspired, phoned-in, and a bad impersonation of Playboi Carti, and the feature verse from Drake\u2019s 5-year-old son Adonis Graham at the end is a ridiculous addition to the song (although he\u2019s 5 years old and has no musical experience, Drake chose to put his verse on this song and have the beat switch for it, so it\u2019s definitely his fault for Adonis\u2019 verse being terrible and an unnecessary addition to the track). This song is yet another example of Drake biting the rage trend and finishing the song with an entirely different beat that features his son doing a rap verse that you would expect from a 5-year-old boy.\u201cFirst Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole)\u201d: Definitely the best song on the album so far. The intro from J. Cole was good and the first verse from Drake was very good, as he used a flow that was similar to his flow on Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cMELTDOWN (feat. Drake)\u201d and had some good lyrics despite a few lines that were incredibly repetitive and belabored the points he was trying to make. The second verse from J. Cole was absolutely awesome, as his flow was on point, his lyrics were great, and his references to his upcoming album The Fall Off, him, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar being the three greatest rappers of all time, the Spider-Man meme being \u201chim looking at Drake,\u201d and a cool wordplay with Wake Forest University were all hitting hard. The beat for the first part with those two verses, which was produced Boi-1da, FNZ, Vinylz, and OZ, was insanely good, and the second beat from Tay Keith was really good as well. The third verse from Drake was very repetitive and dropped some cringy lines, but he finished strong with a reference to his chart position and Michael Jackson and his hit song \u201cBeat It (with Van Halen).\u201d The third verse is average at best. J. Cole definitely outperformed Drake on here, but he pushed Drake to do better than he\u2019s done so far on this album. Good song.\u201cIDGAF (feat. Yeat)\u201d: Great song, but it\u2019s not really a Drake song. The production from BNYX\u00ae on this song is absolutely awesome, as the sample from British psychedelic jazz band Azimuth for the first minute of the song with some psychedelic BNYX\u00ae synths that leads into a great rage beat is a testament to how great of a producer he is. The chorus from Yeat is great, and although Drake has been made fun of for his ad-libbed \u201cmoney for fun\u201d on the chorus, it doesn\u2019t sound bad and the chorus is still great. The first verse from Drake is very good, and though it has some rage elements and is very repetitive and not extremely dense lyrically, Drake does a good job with it and definitely makes the best case for himself doing rage music with it. Yeat\u2019s verse is good as well, but his verse somewhat falls apart when he switches up his vocal delivery from a deep, low-pitched, and gritty delivery to a high-pitched delivery where he warbles and raps melodically in auto-tune. This song is pretty much a regular Yeat & BNYX\u00ae song where Drake is featured. Forget Drake featuring Drake (as Drizzy once said on his song \u201c5PM In New York\u201d), this song is Yeat featuring Drake on Drizzy\u2019s own album.\u201c7969 Santa (feat. Chief Keef, Snoop Dogg & Teezo Touchdown)\u201d: The production from Jahaan Sweet & BNYX\u00ae on this song was great, as they made a very mellow minimalist instrumental with a strong and subtle trap drum pattern, but Drake\u2019s two verses were absolutely awful, as his melodic rapping was offbeat, his flow was absolutely horrendous, and his lyrics made no sense and had no cohesive subject whatsoever. His singing on the chorus was horrendously awful as well, as his vocals were terrible, his flow was offbeat, and it was ridiculously repetitive yet again. The beat cuts off halfway through a measure and transitions into a weird grand piano instrumental that Teezo Touchdown starts singing over. His singing starts off well, but his lyrics are awful, his flow was weird, and his singing fell off towards the end of his part. The spoken interlude from Snoop Dogg was cool, as he was sort of like a radio DJ queueing up the next song, but it was really too little, too late for this song. Another piece of crap song.\u201cSlime You Out (feat. SZA)\u201d: The lead single for this album, and it\u2019s completely terrible. I can\u2019t believe how bad this song is. The first two verses are absolutely and unequivocally awful, as Drake sings and raps melodically offbeat and offkey with some lyrics that are absolutely awful, tone-deaf, and ridiculously out-of-pocket. The chorus from Drake was abhorrently awful as well, as it was completely phoned in with trash vocals. The third verse from SZA was mid at best because the lyrics were bad and the vocals were a little better than average. The fourth verse from Drake includes a beat switch that reverses the main beat from 40 & BNYX\u00ae that was mid to begin with and has bad lyrics that show Drake going through the months of the year and describing his girlfriend\u2019s habits throughout the year, and Drake sounds like an emo 15-year-old kid writing poetry with them. The lyrics are absolutely awful on this song. Another horrendously trash song.\u201cTried Our Best (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)\u201d: The first part of the song is quite good, as it sounds like the previous collaborations between Drake & Ty Dolla $ign from Scorpion and Certified Lover Boy \u201cJaded (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)\u201d & \u201cGet Along Better (feat. Ty Dolla $ign),\u201d and Drake\u2019s vocals, lyrics, and flows are good, but after the overly repetitive chorus that features vocals from Ty Dolla $ign, the song transitions into a second verse where Drake is overly repetitive, whiny, lamenting about girls ruining his evenings and expensive dinners, and dropping bad bars that he thinks are good quotables, which are all common themes for this album. Mid song.\u201cMembers Only (feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)\u201d: This song has now taken the title for worst Drake song away from \u201cCalling For You (feat. 21 Savage)\u201d and subsequently \u201cDrew A Picasso.\u201d Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR are notoriously hit or miss on their collaborations, as they can be really good like \u201cPreach (feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)\u201d on If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late or really bad like \u201cRatchet Happy Birthday (feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)\u201d from Scorpion. This song is now the worst Drake song of all time, as the production from 40 is simply uninspired, lackluster, and mid, and the first and third verses from Drake are two of his worst verses of all time. The lines that Drake drops on the first and third verses and the chorus are horrendously awful and make me question how he ever recorded them and said \u201cYeah, this sounds like a banger, let\u2019s drop it.\u201d The same can be said about a lot of the lyrics on this album, but this song takes the cake for some of the worst lines on the album. \u201cYou\u2019re too down with the gangy, you\u2019re one of my members,\u201d \u201cFeel like I\u2019m bi \u2018cause you\u2019re one of the guys, girl,\u201d \u201cI live like 40 minutes from you, that sex drive crazy,\u201d \u201cBoth cummin\u2019 at the same time like, \u2018Jinx,\u2019 I\u2019m talkin\u2019 dirty,\u201d and \u201cN-Y-see me later when I\u2019m right there like New Jersey.\u201d Absolutely and unequivocally the worst Drake song of all time, competing with two other songs on this album for that title and ultimately winning out.\u201cAll The Parties (feat. Chief Keef & George Clinton)\u201d: Complete cringy trash. The production from BNYX\u00ae & 40 is mid at best, as they went with a lo-fi, laid-back, low-key, and minimalist set of beats that did not work because Drake\u2019s verses and Chief Keef\u2019s featured chorus (which Drake did two more times after Chief Keef got cut off at the end of the first beat) were absolute garbage with offbeat flows, terrible vocals on the parts where Drake sang and rapped melodically, and bad lyrics. Drake\u2019s verses paint him as a pathetic simp who is whining about girls who rejected him in the past and blaming them for all the problems he has. He sounds like he\u2019s rapping from the perspective of his character from Degrassi: a down bad 15-year-old emo kid who got rejected by his crush after he asked her out. He\u2019s also whining about his girl being in love with Chief Keef, and for no reason at all, he sings the chorus for Pet Shop Boys\u2019 amazing song \u201cWest End Girls\u201d without auto-tune and in a cringy, stupid, and pitchy vocal cadence. The spoken outro from Funkadelic\u2019s George Clinton was unnecessary, weird, and cringy.\u201c8AM In Charlotte\u201d: A time and place song, which Drake is known for normally being very good on, and he did not disappoint with this song. The production from Conductor Williams is extremely good, as it sounds like an old Drake song with a chopped-up soul sample and a smooth piano melody that sounds absolutely great. The three verses Drake drops on this song are all very good, but there are a couple of bad lines in each verse that keep each verse from being great. There are some great lines and some of Drake\u2019s best lyrics on the album on this song, but a few filler lines and a few wack bars prevent the song from achieving the same level of greatness of the other songs with the time and place titles.Drake is my favorite artist of all time. It\u2019s taken me a while to be able to admit it, but I believe I can confidently say that Drake is my all-time favorite artist. He\u2019s definitely battling for the spot with a few other artists that I absolutely love across genres, but I started listening to Drake in elementary school when he dropped the now classic albums Take Care (2011) and Nothing Was The Same (2013), and picked up listening to him for good in 2018 after he dropped the mega smash hit \u201cGod\u2019s Plan.\u201d I haven\u2019t looked back after that. Drake has been with me for a long time as my all-time favorite artist. I have two posters of him on my wall (the Take Care & Nothing Was The Same album covers, my two favorite album covers of his) and two t-shirts with the Thank Me Later and Take Care album covers. Drake is a titan in the music industry. When he drops an album, the world stops to listen. He is immune to falling off because of the status he has achieved in the music industry. Drake is an artist who has achieved such a position that he will still be talked about in a hundred years for the impact he had on the music industry. Alongside artists like Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, JAY-Z, Rihanna, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Madonna, Cher, Adele, formerly Kanye West before he ruined his career and legacy by going on an anti-Semitic tirade, The Weeknd, and Travis Scott (who only just achieved this megastar titan status). These artists are a rare breed of artists who have gotten so big over the years that they seem too big to fail. They can\u2019t fall off because of how far they\u2019ve come. No matter what they do, they will make headlines when they drop music. The biggest flaw that comes from Drake achieving this status is that he now feels like he can do whatever he wants in his music: He can drop a 23-track album where most of the songs are absolutely garbage and sound nothing like the majority of his old music that was actually good where the featured artists include the dregs of the music industry. In addition to getting his 5-year-old son Adonis Graham to rap on a boom bap beat at the end of a rage song, Drake tapped Teezo Touchdown (whose garbage album he co-signed and called \u201csome of the best music ever\u201d), Sexyy Red (an artist who is unbelievably trash and actually manages to be worse than Ice Spice and still popular), Chief Keef (who essentially cemented his fall-off with his garbage performances on this album), and Lil Yachty to do garbage rage music as opposed to the psychedelia he did on his switch-up album Let\u2019s Start Here.. The lyrics on this album have to be some of the worst I\u2019ve ever heard from any mainstream artist who claims to be a good lyricist. The lyrics on this album make the lyrical blunders on Drake\u2019s Certified Lover Boy look like Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp A Butterfly. The vocals are laughably awful, and Drake\u2019s cringe knows no bounds, especially when he\u2019s trying to do a Puerto Rican and Jamaican accent on a song with Bad Bunny. Half of this tracklist qualifies as being Drake\u2019s worst songs of all time. The production on this album is very mid overall, as most of the beats are entirely lackluster and have no substance whatsoever. 40 will definitely have to work his way back into my good graces after some of the stupidly mid beats he produced for this album, and BNYX\u00ae is no longer vying for a top 10 spot on my all-time favorite GOAT producers list after this album, where he failed to make several rage beats that were any good. Lil Yachty also needs to stay out of the beat production studio and stick to singing because the beats he made on this album (especially the rage beats) were absolutely trash. This album was carried by three songs: \u201cIDGAF (feat. Yeat),\u201d the only song above 9 on the entire album (which has a pretty great beat from BNYX\u00ae), \u201cFirst Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole)\u201d (where Drake rapped well but J. Cole ultimately stole the show), and \u201c8AM In Charlotte,\u201d another entry into Drake\u2019s time and location song series that had one of the best beats on the album produced by Conductor Williams. Ultimately, this album entirely lacked cohesion or a central concept, and on every track, Drake seemed to sound like a pathetic simp who whined about girls ruining his life and girls ruining his ability to have fun in lavish vacation destinations or at fancy dinners. Drake on this album sounded like the type of guy to say \u201cnice guys finish last\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s the girls' fault I\u2019m not cool.\u201d He sounded like an immature high school boy on most of these songs who\u2019s emo and got rejected by a girl he liked, and he now has a personal vendetta against her. I mean, why is there a need to drop Hayley Karrina\u2019s name on \u201cBahamas Promises\u201d and whine about her breaking up with you? Drake has announced a hiatus from music after this album, and I would say it\u2019s much needed. He needs to figure out who he is before the next album because as far as I\u2019m concerned, this album is not a real Drake album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released June 21, 2019Genres: Trap, Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop Rap, Dirty SouthTracks:Bussdown \u2013 6.3Backwards (feat.

DJ Drama & Peewee Longway) \u2013 3.5Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cSpecial (with Anuel AA)\u201d: This song is abysmally awful. Why did Gucci Mane think it was a good idea to collab with Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Anuel AA on a basic, trite, contrived, and entirely mid Murda Beatz trap instrumental? At the very least, Gucci Mane doesn\u2019t try to imitate Anuel AA\u2019s flow or do reggaeton with this song, but this track is the most blatant attempt of hopping on a trend that I\u2019ve ever seen. Gucci Mane\u2019s two verses on this song are uninspired, lifeless, and listless, as he doesn\u2019t say anything remotely interesting and he raps as if he knows this song is filler. The chorus is annoying and repetitive, as Gucci Mane repeats \u201cI don\u2019t need diamonds to make me special, I\u2019m special\u201d about ten times on each chorus, and he sounds just as tired and contrived as he does on the verses with the chorus. The third verse from Anuel AA is absolutely terrible, as his ad-libs are cringy, his flow is too fast, his vocal cadence doesn\u2019t fit the beat at all (Murda Beatz actually altered the beat for his verse and somehow managed to make it sound worse), and he sounds completely out-of-place and off-putting on this song. With the intro track, Gucci Mane was simply mid, but with the Meek Mill collab and this ill-advised collab, he\u2019s showing that he\u2019s on the road to making his worst album yet.\u201cICE (feat. Gunna & Lil Baby)\u201d: Production from Rockin Wit Slime & London On Da Track is good on this song; the piano arpeggio that is showcased on the chorus and appears throughout the verses alongside the somewhat sparse trap drum pattern is the best part of the song. Even though this song is Gucci Mane\u2019s, he only did the chorus on here and outperformed both Gunna & Lil Baby on here. I never thought that would be the case, but Gunna & Lil Baby bombed on their verses. Gucci Mane had the most fire line on the song at the end of the chorus: \u201cAll this ice on me, I pray to God they don\u2019t deport me\u201d (a play on words with the immigration agency ICE and the slang term for jewelry \u201cice\u201d). Gunna\u2019s verse was bad and Lil Baby\u2019s verse was bad as well; they both rapped as if they didn\u2019t want to be on the song and were completely phoning in their verses. Another bag fumble for Gucci Mane.\u201cLove Thru The Computer (feat. Justin Bieber)\u201d: W sample choice by J. White Did It; \u201cComputer Love (feat. Charlie Wilson & Shirley Murdock)\u201d by Zapp is a great song and usually makes for a great sample (that pretty much goes for every Zapp song, as Roger Troutman pioneered the talkbox, synth funk, and G-funk with the bangers he put out with Zapp), but J. White Did It is a mid at best producer who used the sample in a very basic way. He pitched up the vocals from the first verse and looped them while a bland and flavorless trap drum pattern played over it. Gucci Mane\u2019s lyrics on this song are abhorrently bad, and his two verses are laughably trash. Justin Bieber\u2019s chorus is actually above average, as the auto-tune use is well-executed and kind of sounds like Roger Troutman & Zapp. His second verse that follows that chorus is mid, though, as neither he nor Gucci Mane seem to know what this song is supposed to be about. A failed collaboration that can best be described as an attempt at \u201cstreet pop,\u201d a genre that never works.\u201cHands Off (feat. Jeremih)\u201d: On the chorus, Jeremih\u2019s vocals are good and his smooth delivery is on point, but the lyrics are repetitive and mundane, and though the first chorus was the best thing on this album so far, the third one sounded redundant and overdone (the only lyrics are \u201cHands off of you / I can\u2019t keep my hands off of you\u201d). The first verse from Gucci Mane is average; his delivery is smooth and his lyrics display genuine emotion and show him falling hard for his girlfriend. The second verse from Gucci Mane has some cringe lines and is mid, though. The production from OG Parker and Hitmaka is smooth and mellow, but it\u2019s nothing too special and is a little above average. This song is the best track so far on the album, but it\u2019s mid.\u201cSuperstar\u201d: Normally, Gucci Mane using auto-tune to sing or rap melodically is ridiculous, dumb, and stupid, but this time, Gucci Mane used auto-tune to rap melodically on an extremely smooth minimalist acoustic guitar beat and it worked pretty well. Gucci Mane\u2019s vocals were smooth, sultry, and seductive, which is exactly the effect he was going for and the first time he\u2019s ever done that well with making his vocals sound like an R&B singer. The chorus was above average (there were a few cringy lines in it that kept it from being better), the first verse was good, and the second verse was mid, as Gucci Mane used some cringy lines that prevented the song from being any better. The lines he used completely ruined the smooth, sultry, and seductive delivery he was going for; it sounded like Gucci Mane was trying to pick up a girl but threw an incredibly out of pocket or weird comment in with his attempted seduction. Definitely would\u2019ve scared the girl off and made the song mid.\u201cUpgrade (feat. Nav\u00e9 Monjo)\u201d: Another incredibly bland and generic beat from J. White Did It that has a contrived trap drum pattern and a stupidly simple melody. The chorus from Nav\u00e9 Monjo (A Kansas City based R&B singer signed to Tech N9ne\u2019s label, which should tell you everything you need to know, as Tech N9ne is one of the \u201cfast rap = good rap\u201d battle rappers who thinks he can make good music just because he raps fast) is mid at best, as it sounds like he\u2019s trying to imitate The Weeknd and doing a terrible job. His vocals are pitchy, his lyrics are repetitive, and his delivery is weird and forced. Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse is mid at best, as his flow is garbage and he doesn\u2019t say anything of substance, but his second verse is absolutely awful, as the cringe and bad lyrics know no limits in that verse. He pulls out every stupid line he can on that verse, and it knocks the song down quite a few points. Another fumbled R&B-infusion collaboration.\u201cLame (feat. Rick Ross & Wiz Khalifa)\u201d: This track had such potential and said potential was almost fully realized. The beat from Southside & PVLACE was a high-octane trap beat with hard-hitting drums and a great melody, which was awesome, and the flows from Gucci Mane, Wiz Khalifa, and Rick Ross on their verses were all great. The problems arose with the chorus and the lyrics. Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse was very good, but on the chorus, he was repetitive, boring, and tried to sing, which made for a pretty mid chorus overall (it was carried by the beat and the ad-libs from Wiz Khalifa & Rick Ross). Wiz Khalifa\u2019s second verse was very good until he tried to switch the flow up in the latter half, which made the verse average overall. Rick Ross' verse was great until he dropped this bar: \u201cBend over, I got a b**** I pay to wipe my a$$ / Caught a seizure, I\u2019m the s\u2014, this time l peed my pants.\u201d What was that man even on when he said that? It\u2019s gotta be one of the more out-of-pocket and ridiculous lines I\u2019ve heard in a while. He completely ruined his verse with that line. This song was very promising and holds the top spot on the album for now, but the bag was ultimately fumbled.\u201cPotential (feat. Lil Uzi Vert & Young Dolph)\u201d: Instrumental from Ricky Racks is very good. The chorus from Gucci Mane is bad, as it\u2019s repetitive, the lyrics are dumb, weird, and degrading to Gucci Mane and the woman he\u2019s trying to get with on this song. The first verse from Lil Uzi Vert has a great flow and the vocals are deep, gritty, and menacing (unlike most of Uzi\u2019s songs where he sounds high-pitched and quite often cringy), but the lyrics are garbage and repetitive, so the verse is mid. The second verse from Gucci Mane suffers from the same bad lyrics as the chorus, so it\u2019s just as bad if not worse. The third verse from Young Dolph is better than the first two verses, as Young Dolph\u2019s flow is very strong and his lyrics are good for the most part, but this entire song, which is basically these three dudes talking about a girl\u2019s a$$ and flexing how many girls they\u2019ve smashed, lends itself to bad lyrics and crappy bars that ultimately land awkwardly. Young Dolph\u2019s verse suffers from that paradigm, so it\u2019s a little better than mid. Overall, this song is pretty bad despite a good beat.\u201cHuman Chandelier\u201d: Absolute and unequivocal cringe. There have been a few songs on this album that are in contention for the worst Gucci Mane song of all time, as Gucci Mane seems to be putting as little effort into some of these songs as he possibly can. Gucci Mane\u2019s first verse was mid, but the chorus was ridiculously bad (Gucci Mane tried singing again, but this time without auto-tune, which was definitely worse), and the second verse is stupidly awful. This song is egregiously bad. The DJ Khaled quote \u201cI call her chandelier\u201d makes more sense and has more merit than this entire track.\u201cOutro (Delusions Of Grandeur) (feat. DJ Drama & Peewee Longway)\u201d: A fittingly trash end to a garbage album. The spoken intro from DJ Drama on this song that basically claims Gucci Mane is the GOAT is cringy, unnecessary, and doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense (not just because Gucci Mane isn\u2019t the GOAT, but just because DJ Drama is just rambling about nothing). The first verse and chorus from Gucci Mane are atrociously bad, as Gucci Mane\u2019s ad-libs sound like either a kid whining or a dude straining on the toilet, especially on the chorus, and they completely ruin the song. I feel bad for Peewee Longway because his verse was pretty good, as he had a solid flow, some good lyrics, and pretty good vocal delivery, but unfortunately, the production from Honorable C.N.O.T.E. was shockingly mid and disjointed, which made it hard for anyone to rap well on it. This song is just another example of Gucci Mane totally phoning it in over a mid beat, which accurately represents most of this album.Albums like this one are what gives pop rap as a genre a bad name. There\u2019s a lot of examples of beautiful fusions of the genres of hip-hop and pop, but albums like this one are why pop rap as a genre is not respected. Gucci Mane made the most generic, watered-down, bland, banal, and basic (although calling this album \u201cbasic\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to how generic-sounding it is) pop rap trap album with this 18-track project, and it\u2019s shameful how bad it was. Gucci Mane has never been one of my favorite artists, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s much better as a featured artist than as a solo artist on his albums. Aside from a couple of good songs, his most popular album Mr. Davis was pretty bad, and this album is just Mr. Davis if it was less creative, had worse production, worse features, and worse performances by Gucci Mane. Gucci Mane is clearly trying to appeal to the mainstream and get this album on the charts with collaborations with Justin Bieber and Anuel AA, but these songs are so far outside of Gucci Mane\u2019s normal style that they sound completely ridiculous. It\u2019s a blatant attempt by Gucci Mane to hop on trends and capitalize on the popularity of Justin Bieber and the reggaeton genre, and in the process, he compromises his integrity as an artist. Gucci Mane also recruits Tay Keith to produce a few tracks on this album, a producer he\u2019s never worked with before and with whom he has no chemistry. Gucci Mane rapping on watered-down Memphis rage hip-hop beats sounds dumb and simply doesn\u2019t work. This album is clearly an example of Gucci Mane making generic pop rap chart fodder, and some of his solo songs are laughably bad, especially those on which he tries to sing with or without auto-tune. \u201cSpecial\u201d is an interesting song because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard Gucci Mane actually sound pretty good while singing and rapping melodically, but that song is a fluke, as every other time Gucci Mane tries to do those things, he totally fails. There are times where the featured artists outperform Gucci Mane and help him out, but for the most part, they\u2019re as bad or worse than he is. Obviously, a collab between A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Gucci Mane is gonna be bad, since both those guys are horribly formulaic and generic rappers, but I expected way more out of a Gunna & Lil Baby collab where both Gunna & Lil Baby sounded like absolute crap. Gucci Mane attempted R&B collaborations again on this album, and once again, he couldn\u2019t get it done on them. The Rick Ross & Wiz Khalifa collaboration was almost good, but because of some crappy lyrics and bad flows from all three artists, it failed to be the only good song on this album. Overall, this album is complete and total garbage.

Sizzla)\u201d: Off to a horrendously awful start with this intro track. DJ Khaled produced this track alongside Danja; the producer who worked with Justin Timberlake & Timbaland on FutureSex / LoveSound, Man Of The Woods, and JAY-Z\u2019s Magna Carta\u2026 Holy Grail; and although Danja does a good job with the percussion on this song, this beat is absolutely atrocious. The song starts off with some nature sounds, then devolves into an instrumental that sounds like a fusion of reggae dancehall and Afrobeat that\u2019s executed terribly. This song sounds like it\u2019s trying to copy traditional Yoruba music while simultaneously being reggae or dancehall, and it comes off sounding like a rejected track from the soundtrack to The Lion King for those reasons. Although DJ Khaled gives some loving messages to his newborn son on this song, Sizzla\u2019s verses and chorus on this track have nothing to do with them, and half the time on his verses, Sizzla is just spouting nonsense and making no sense with his flow or vocal delivery. Sizzla\u2019s vocals on the chorus are among the worst I\u2019ve ever heard; it\u2019s as if he\u2019s trying to sing it badly, and his vocals on the verses aren\u2019t much better. His lyrics have nothing to do with the song\u2019s subject matter either. When DJ Khaled\u2019s ad-libs are the best part of a DJ Khaled song, something is seriously wrong. That\u2019s what happened on this song, and it was a total flop.\u201cShining (feat. Beyonc\u00e9 & JAY-Z)\u201d: Elegant pop with a Dionne Warwick sample produced by DJ Khaled & Danja with vocals from two artists who frequently make music in the elegant pop genre. The production on this song, especially the clear drums and warm synth chords from Danja, is good, and the Dionne Warwick sample is very well executed, but at times, the production seems as though it\u2019s lacking a few elements. The synth chords are a bit repetitive and the drums sound like they need a better melody to play off. It\u2019s as if Danja needed Timbaland or Justin Timberlake on this track to complete the song. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s vocals on this song are great, as they often are (she has a voice that can sing the phone book), but the lyrics and flows on her two verses and choruses are mid at best. She\u2019s not really saying anything of value on her verses, and her flows are frequently disjointed and offbeat. The third verse from JAY-Z is good; the wordplay is good and he flows well, but it\u2019s not great. His lyrics are great when he\u2019s doing clever wordplay or bragging about living lavishly, but when he isn\u2019t doing those things, he\u2019s just going through the motions. JAY-Z didn\u2019t really sound inspired on that verse, but he still managed to make it good, which was cool. Mid song despite it being elegant pop, which is one of my favorite genres.\u201cTo The Max (with JayO feat. Drake, Jodie Aysha & 1WayFrank)\u201d: \u201cDid the Drake vocals come in yet?\u201d DJ Khaled has asked so many times on his social media promotions that it\u2019s become a running joke. For this song, the Drake vocals came in, but DJ Khaled used them in a worse way than anyone who\u2019s ever had a Drake feature has used them. Drake has cosigned some pretty trash artists over the years and has lent features to some questionable individuals, but this song is the worst beat Drake has ever been featured on. The production from Cool N Dre & DJ Khaled on this song is flooded with cacophonous and disjointed samples that make it next to impossible to follow the beat, and each sample seems to be worse than the others. The JayO sample that says \u201cget \u2018em right, get 'em right\u201d throughout the song is stupid, dumb, and ridiculous, and the 1WayFrank sample that gives the chorus is almost equally as bad, except for that it sounds like someone is trying to do a parody of Drake when 1WayFrank is singing on that chorus. The vocals from Jodie Aysha sound nice, but it\u2019s impossible to make out what she\u2019s saying amidst the earrape level drums and the constant use of other samples throughout the song. The first verse from Drake is actually good, but it sounds as though he recorded it for an entirely different song, and the second verse from Drake is mid and somewhat off the beat because of how absolutely horrendous the production is. In all seriousness, this song might be in contention for one of the worst beats of all time and undoubtedly one of the biggest bag fumbles of a Drake feature in history. The Drake vocals came in, and hearing this song makes me wish they\u2019d stayed with Drake.\u201cWild Thoughts (with Carlos Santana feat. Bryson Tiller & Rihanna)\u201d: DJ Khaled teamed up again with L.V.M. and DJ Nasty to see if he could recreate the R&B success he achieved on Major Key with the banger that featured R&B singers Chris Brown, Jeremih, and August Alsina, as well as rappers Nicki Minaj, Future, and Rick Ross with a collaboration with Rihanna and Bryson Tiller using a sample from Santana\u2019s \u201cMaria Maria (feat. The Product G&B)\u201d that mainly featured Carlos Santana\u2019s guitar. He couldn\u2019t recreate that success because this song was trash! Rihanna\u2019s vocals on this song sounded lazy and phoned-in, especially on the chorus, and her verses had bad lyrics and bad flows. Rihanna sounded worse on this song than she ever has in her solo music, and I daresay this track might be her worst feature of all time. Bryson Tiller, one of the most mid R&B singers of all time (the bargain-brand American version of PARTYNEXTDOOR), dropped a verse on this song with these cringy quotables: \u201cF*** you \u2018til you burned out, cream-ation,\u201d \u201cMake it cream, Wu-Tang, ayy,\u201d (disrespect to a great song), \u201cI\u2019m carryin\u2019 that water, Bobby Boucher,\u201d and \u201cWhite girl wasted on brown liquor.\u201d What was this guy on about in this verse? A cringe and dumb verse from a guy who sounds like both a creepy nerd and a douchebag frat boy in the same breath. In addition, the Carlos Santana guitar sample did not work at all on this track. The guitar was piercing, off-putting, and completely out of place on this song, as its sound completely contrasted the downtempo R&B sound DJ Khaled was going for with this track. A complete and total L, another bag fumble.\u201cI\u2019m The One (feat. Chance The Rapper, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne & Quavo)\u201d: Listening to this song is enough to make anyone hate both the genres of pop and hip-hop music. This track is a perfect example of what would happen if someone took everything that makes pop music and hip-hop music good, sucked it out, then made a song with what was left over. This song was produced by DJ Khaled, Bobby Brackins, and Nic Nac (best known for his work with Pia Mia and Chris Brown on his X album, or his producer tag, which sounds like someone saying \u201clet me see\u201d), and it\u2019s probably the most generic, watered-down, basic, contrived, and trite pop rap beat of all time. The beat repeats every four measures and is driven by a bland 808 bassline, a crap drum pattern, and an annoyingly bad vocal sample. Similar to the beat, the chorus from Justin Bieber is what would happen if someone took everything remotely creative from the genre of pop rap, removed it, and made a chorus with what was left over. Lyrics suck, vocals suck, and everything about it just sucks. Justin Bieber might be trying to recreate the swagger and hip-hop vocal cadence he had on Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cMaria I\u2019m Drunk (feat. Justin Bieber & Young Thug),\u201d but he failed miserably. Quavo\u2019s verse on this song was actually the best one, and that\u2019s probably because this album was released in 2017, at a time when Quavo and the rest of Migos had just dropped Culture and couldn\u2019t miss if they wanted to. Quavo\u2019s verse is good, but it\u2019s not great, as he\u2019s mostly just coasting off hype and how bad everyone else on the song is. Chance The Rapper\u2026 oh, man. What can I even say about Chance\u2019s verse on this song except: How did no one realize he was a cringy, stupid cornball from this verse? I could\u2019ve predicted every song on Chance\u2019s debut album The Big Day from this one verse. It\u2019s garbage in every way it can be. Lil Wayne\u2019s verse is mid at best on this track; he shows up and shouts out DJ Khaled, but that\u2019s about all he does. Justin Bieber & Chance The Rapper take the cake for cringe on this song, though, as they\u2019re both unlistenably awful. Straight up garbage.\u201cOn Everything (feat. Big Sean, Rick Ross & Travis Scott)\u201d: The epic bag fumbles continue. How does someone actually get a song with three cheat-code features: Big Sean, Rick Ross & Travis Scott; and make it bad? Well, one of the ways is piss-poor mixing, and this song definitely had that. Travis Scott\u2019s chorus sounds grainy and the auto-tune isn\u2019t clear at all, and the sample from Mark Pritchard\u2019s \u201cUnder The Sun\u201d is overpoweringly loud, especially when it\u2019s contrasted with the verses and chorus. Rick Ross' verse is also mixed poorly, as his vocals are muddied and unclear, and the low end of his voice overpowers everything else. This song sounds like the mixing engineer turned every knob on the equalizer all the way up and said to DJ Khaled & Danja: \u201cTrust me bro.\u201d The production on this song is also terrible, as that vocal sample was garbage and the melody that surrounded it was equally trash, as the vocal sample was made the focal point of the song and eventually overpowered everything else. However, the ultimate blow to a song with three cheat-code features is those artists not performing at full capacity, and nobody went hard on this song. The chorus from Travis Scott was unbelievably and uncharacteristically lazy and phoned-in, as if Travis Scott recorded it in five minutes after a long day of working on something he actually cared about. His chorus screamed apathy. Rick Ross' verse was mid because some of his lyrics were recycled, his subject matter was unclear, and the ad-libs were laughably bad (and poorly mixed). Big Sean sounded half-baked and phoned-in on his verse, as he flowed monotonously and went through the motions lyrically to finish that verse. His verse, much like Travis' chorus, screamed apathy. This song sounds like a party dying because no one wants to be there.\u201cIt\u2019s Secured (feat. Nas & Travis Scott)\u201d: It hurts my heart that this song is bad. This track has two of my all-time favorite artists, both GOATs on my top 10 and maybe top 5 list of all-time top-tier GOAT hip-hop artists, and it sucks. The main reason: The production from DJ Khaled, 808 Ray & Cool N Dre. People need to stop letting DJ Khaled in the studio because these beats are complete garbage. I\u2019m thinking this album was the last one where DJ Khaled was involved in the production because people realized how trash these beats are. This beat, which had a gaudy, triumphant, and grandiose horn melody, cacophonous and overly complex drums, and crappy 808s, was impossible for anyone to rap well on. Both Nas & Travis Scott sounded awkward on this beat because it had too many changes and continued to shift in both BPM and sound. Both of Nas' verses might\u2019ve been good because his lyrics were good, but he was completely offbeat and sounded as if he\u2019d recorded the verses for an entirely different song. Travis Scott\u2019s chorus started out strong, but it eventually devolved into apathetic and phoned-in \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\u201d vocals. This chorus also sounded like Travis Scott recorded it in five minutes after a long day of working on something he actually cared about. I hope with everything in me that this song is not the last collab between Nas & Travis because those guys would be awesome if they were both going hard on a great beat. Unfortunately, DJ Khaled couldn\u2019t get it done and fumbled another massive bag.\u201cNobody (feat. Alicia Keys & Nicki Minaj)\u201d: Nicki Minaj casually just dropped the best verse on the album so far, but nobody (no pun intended) is gonna notice because of how trash the rest of the song was. Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse was incredible, but DJ Khaled, Cool N Dre, and 808 Ray produced a beat that sounds like the bargain-brand version of \u201cLord Knows (feat. Rick Ross)\u201d by Drake with a sample on this track of \u201cNobody Knows\u201d by Pastor T.L. Barrett and the Youth For Christ Choir. The sample is poorly executed, badly mixed, and overpowering, and this song is way too long, as Alicia Keys had a mid chorus, but after Nicki\u2019s verse, she basically drags that chorus out for two and a half minutes by saying absolutely nothing and phoning in vocals in the process. She\u2019s essentially just buying time so the track will be longer but not saying anything of remote substance. Such a poorly handled song that could\u2019ve been great with that Nicki verse.\u201cI Love You So Much (feat. Chance The Rapper, Carter Lang, Dariu, Jamila Woods, Jack Red & The Jackson 5)\u201d: This song seriously sounds like it could\u2019ve been on Chance The Rapper\u2019s flop of a debut album The Big Day, as the lyrics are repetitive, cringy, stupid, and corny (both from Chance The Rapper & DJ Khaled), and the vocals from Chance The Rapper are beyond cringe, if that\u2019s even possible. What was this guy thinking singing the ABC\u2019s on this song? Why did he think that was a good idea? However, the two things this song has going for it are the sample of The Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cABC\u201d and the choir vocals in the background from Carter Lang, Dariu, Jack Red & Jamila Woods. This song is extremely gratuitous, ridiculously stupid, and the literal definition of tongue-and-cheek, but there are a couple of good elements that prevent it from being an 0.1, but just barely because this song is actually unfiltered cringe in most places.\u201cDon\u2019t Quit (with Calvin Harris feat. Jeremih & Travis Scott)\u201d: It\u2019s a travesty that this song didn\u2019t end up on Calvin Harris' Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 album, as it\u2019s actually better than the Travis Scott collab from that album \u201cPrayers Up (feat. Travis Scott & A-Trak),\u201d and it has the additional feature from Jeremih. Travis Scott may be a great rapper and a great psychedelic artist, but he can make summer anthems and does really well over funky Calvin Harris beats, and this track is just another example of that paradigm. Travis Scott\u2019s vocals on this track are warm, playful, and infectiously good, as Travis Scott playfully addresses a summer crush in his verses and on his chorus, telling her he needs her in his life. This song, much like \u201cK-POP (with Bad Bunny & The Weeknd),\u201d \u201cWAKE UP (feat. The Weeknd),\u201d and the aforementioned Calvin Harris & Travis Scott collab, has a distinct summer sound, and this beat, produced by Calvin Harris, is undoubtedly the best beat on the album so far. I thought the verse from Jeremih would\u2019ve been superfluous since Travis Scott was doing his thing, but Jeremih absolutely killed it on his verse, bringing the same playful, warm, summer vocals on his verse and adding his own personal R&B flare to it. This song is amazing, and for that reason, it was probably supposed to be on Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 before DJ Khaled bought it and put it on this album.\u201cI Can\u2019t Even Lie (feat. Future & Nicki Minaj)\u201d: The verses from Future & Nicki Minaj on this song were both great, and while Future\u2019s chorus got off to a rocky start, the part where he says \u201cI can\u2019t even lie to you\u201d a few times is great and segues brilliantly into both his verse and Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse. Future\u2019s verse is a personal victory lap; it\u2019s all about Future bragging about how he\u2019s him, and Nicki Minaj went 2 for 2 on this album, truly proving why she\u2019s the Queen of Rap with two of the best verses on this album. Nicki Minaj flexes as well on her verse, and she continues to assert her dominance by dropping another heater on this song. The only reason why this song isn\u2019t in the 9-10 range is because of the beat. DJ Khaled & Danja fumbled another bag on this song by literally sampling a MONKEY SCREECHING for this beat. I wish I was making this stuff up, but they actually thought it was a good idea to put a screeching monkey vocal sample on this beat. This song is a perfect example of why DJ Khaled shouldn\u2019t be let anywhere near the studio.\u201cDown For Life (feat. Future, Kodak Black, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Rick Ross & Travis Scott)\u201d: The production on this song isn\u2019t actually that bad, as DJ Khaled & Lee On The Beats do a pretty good job with a downtempo trap instrumental with some R&B influences. The featured artists on this song are what makes the song bad. The chorus from PARTYNEXTDOOR on this song (whose praises I sung earlier on this album for being what Bryson Tiller aspires to be) is extremely mid, boring, and lacking in nuance. It\u2019s essentially Justin Bieber\u2019s chorus from \u201cI\u2019m The One (feat. Chance The Rapper, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne & Quavo),\u201d but actually almost good and not completely devoid of creativity. Regardless, PND disappointed on that chorus. The first verse from Future is mid at best; honestly pretty bad, as his idea of a good start to the verse is to spell out a bunch of words that make no sense when put together. The second verse from Travis Scott is the best one on the song; it\u2019s good but not great and completely carried by Travis Scott\u2019s ethereal \u201cooh\u201d in an auto-tuned falsetto. The third verse from Rick Ross is the worse one on the song; it\u2019s abhorrently bad and likely one of the worst feature verses of Rick Ross' career. The fourth verse from Kodak Black is mid at best; the main thing I\u2019d say about it is that it\u2019s too long and Kodak Black mumbles too much on it. I\u2019m not really sure what DJ Khaled thought would happen when he put these artists on a song together, but I don\u2019t think what he intended to happen actually worked out.\u201cMajor Bag Alert (feat. Migos)\u201d: More like major banger alert! With a beat produced by Quavo & DJ Durel with an airy and ethereal synth melody juxtaposed with a hard-hitting trap drum pattern, booming 808s, and deep horn chords, this song is a perfect example of the \u201cMigos touch\u201d (i.e. the golden touch Migos had in 2017 after they dropped Culture, one of the greatest trap albums ever made). This track should\u2019ve been the DJ Khaled collab that ended up on Culture instead of \u201cCulture (feat. DJ Khaled),\u201d the intro track from Culture. I imagine this track was originally slated for that album and \u201cCulture (feat. DJ Khaled)\u201d was supposed to be on this one, but since DJ Khaled dropped this album a few months after Culture, it would\u2019ve been weird for Takeoff to say \u201cCulture album coming soon\u201d on this album. This song perfectly plays to the strengths of each Migos member. Quavo handles the chorus, Offset takes the first verse and does an amazing job with a surgical and technical flow on it, and Takeoff takes the second verse and uses his hard-hitting bar style and signature wordplay on that verse. This song might be one of Migos' most quintessential tracks, but it\u2019s a shame it wasn\u2019t on their debut album. One of the best songs on this album.\u201cGood Man (feat. Jadakiss & Pusha T)\u201d: This song was a colossal bag fumble on the part of DJ Khaled & 808 Ray, who tried to produce a classic boom bap beat based around a soul sample from the 1967 song \u201cAm I A Good Man\u201d by Them Two. The drums are way too loud, there\u2019s too much stuff going on with the drum pattern, and the soul sample chop was executed poorly. This beat is yet another example of how bad of a producer DJ Khaled is, and it\u2019s another step in the wrong direction for 808 Ray as well, who has produced multiple flop beats on this album thus far. Jadakiss & Pusha T are absolute masters of their craft. These two guys have based their entire careers on rapping about selling cocaine and luxury items, and they\u2019re GOATs because of it. Pusha T is one of my favorite rappers of all time, definitely in my top 10 all-time GOAT list of hip-hop artists, and Jadakiss is probably up there as well, but I\u2019ll need to hear more of his stuff to make a determination. These guys are both top-tier lyricists and are always on point with their vicious and gritty flows. However, Pusha T\u2019s verses on this song were average at best, and Jadakiss' verse was average at best as well. They didn\u2019t perform up to their normal caliber, and something tells me it\u2019s because of how bad the beat was. Leave it to DJ Khaled to get a song with the two greatest drug dealer rappers of all time and ruin it with a bad beat.\u201cBilly Ocean (feat. Fat Joe & Raekwon)\u201d: This song is absolutely awesome. This track is what the previous collab with Jadakiss & Pusha T should\u2019ve been. The production on this song from DJ Khaled, L.V.M., and DJ Nasty was amazing; it might be the best beat this trio has ever made together. The synth piano melody was unbelievably clean, the drum pattern was tasty, and the 808 bass was almost as dynamic as the drum pattern, making it sound very cool. The first verse from Fat Joe was very good; I might have to start considering listening to his solo music because he\u2019s dropped fire verses on back-to-back DJ Khaled albums. His chorus was very good as well, although his attempt at chopping up his voice and stuttering was a bit dumb and somewhat poorly executed, but the lyrics were great on both parts and the flows were solid as well. Raekwon was absolutely awesome on this song; his second verse showed why he should be considered a cheat-code feature, as his lyrics and flow were absolutely on point. The lyrical mastery he exhibited on this track was flawless and this verse with his menacing Wu-Tang boom bap flow was one of the best ones on the album. I was a bit disappointed that this song didn\u2019t sample a Billy Ocean track, but the references to Billy Ocean were pretty cool and playing on his name to talk about an ocean of a billion dollars was a fire idea.\u201cPull A Caper (feat. Gucci Mane, Kodak Black & Rick Ross)\u201d: The production from Ben Billions and DannyBoyStyles on this song is absolutely too fire. The beat, which includes a sample of \u201cAgainst All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)\u201d by Phil Collins, is perfectly downtempo and ethereal with an insanely cool 808 bassline that booms hard. The melody is ethereal and spacey, but the 808 bassline and drums are booming and punchy. It\u2019s a great beat. The chorus from Kodak Black isn\u2019t terrible actually; he leans hard into the nasally and grating falsetto voice he usually does, but juxtaposed with this beat and auto-tuned, he doesn\u2019t sound as bad as he normally does. The chorus ends up being average and listenable. The first verse from Gucci Mane is very good, and despite a few bad lines, he\u2019s able to put out a verse that\u2019s better than the vast majority of his 2017 album Mr. Davis. Rick Ross' verse starts out strong, but everything past his line \u201cI\u2019m the biggest man, you got gonorrhea\u201d is terrible. It amounts to being an alright or average verse from Rick Ross. This song is good overall and it\u2019s a testament to how great of a producer Ben Billions is, as this beat thumps insanely hard.\u201cThat Range Rover Came With Steps (feat. Future & Yo Gotti)\u201d: DJ Khaled teams up with The Beat Bully on this song to make a garbage rendition of \u201cDuel Of The Fates\u201d from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace with crappy trumpets that sound ridiculously off-key and a generic trap drum & 808 pattern that makes no sense with this beat. On an album that\u2019s had some of the worst beats I\u2019ve ever heard, this beat has to be down there with the rest of them because it is gratingly awful. The attempt by DJ Khaled & The Beat Bully to create a melancholy yet grandiose instrumental for Future & Yo Gotti to give long, conscious, introspective verses over absolutely fails. Additionally, the crappy mixing has returned on this song as well, as the vocals and beat both sound grainy and as if they\u2019re too loud, especially the dumb-sounding trumpets (they\u2019re the loudest thing on this beat). Future\u2019s verse is bad, as he attempts to spit a \u201cconscious hip-hop\u201d verse about his life and how he\u2019s under a microscope, but the verse comes off sounding misanthropic and confrontational, and Future sounds more like the character Pink Floyd from Pink Floyd\u2019s The Wall concept album than himself on this verse. Yo Gotti\u2019s verse is abhorrently trash, as he starts off with the line: \u201cI told Furture I could see the furture\u201d (that\u2019s not a typo; he actually says \u201cfurture\u201d instead of future), and the verse progressively gets worse from there, as he employs a lot of the same misanthropic tendencies and sounds like an offbeat Kodak Black trying to be a conscious hip-hop artist on his verse. This song is ridiculously awful and the attempts to be meaningful, deep, and introspective are about as hollow as they come.\u201cIced Out My Arms (feat. Future, Migos, T.I. & 21 Savage)\u201d: The mixing on this song is so bad! The beat from Metro Boomin & Southside is mixed terribly, as the synth chords are way too loud and grainy while the bass is excessively boosted, and the vocals from pretty much everyone on this track are mixed terribly and have grainy elements in them, especially Future\u2019s vocals on the chorus and T.I.\u2019s vocals on the third verse. The production from Metro Boomin & Southside is shockingly mid, as the beat is very generic and formulaic without much nuance or individuality (it\u2019s also mixed very badly), and while Future failed on the last song for trying to do too much, he failed on this song because he did the literal bare minimum he could\u2019ve done. Future literally mumbled on the chorus for this track in the most monotonous voice possible, as if he was either stoned beyond belief or just flat out didn\u2019t want to be there in the studio to record this chorus. Either way, it\u2019s perhaps one of his worst features of all time and is the best case I\u2019ve ever heard for Future being called a \u201cmumble rapper,\u201d as it\u2019s literally what he does on the chorus. Migos appear on this track, but they\u2019re relegated to a group verse for the first verse, and no individual member of the group is given a chance to shine, as they all rap in 4-line parts to fit them all onto one verse. Takeoff also sadly makes a reference to his dead friends on this verse, which makes it a difficult listen, as Takeoff was sadly taken from this world in November of 2022. The group verse was okay, but it was definitely not what I was hoping for. The second verse is handled by 21 Savage, a rapper who had not hit his prime yet and still sounded uncomfortable with his style, even rapping on a Metro Boomin beat. His verse was average at best. The third verse from T.I. was mid, as T.I. sounded out of place and off-putting with his verse despite the fact that he\u2019s the inventor of trap music and deserves a spot on three of trap\u2019s most important artists more than anyone else does. His flows are corny and bad, and his lyrics are surface-level and bland. Overall, a combination of artists and producers that should\u2019ve resulted in a 10 was a total and complete flop.\u201cWhatever (feat. Future, Rick Ross, Young Thug & 2 Chainz)\u201d: The production from Ben Billions, Schife, and Eli On The Beat sounds like what would happen if the 80\u2019s British synthpop group New Order made trap beats. This beat is absolutely incredible! The synth melody sounds like the outro on New Order\u2019s \u201cBizarre Love Triangle,\u201d and the 808 bassline & trap drum pattern are executed perfectly to create an ultimate trap instrumental. This song is maybe the first bubblegum pop trap song I\u2019ve ever heard, but if anyone can do it, it\u2019s Ben Billions with a New Order style beat and features from Future & Young Thug. The auto-tune use from Future & Young Thug on Future\u2019s chorus and Young Thug\u2019s first verse is a bit unorthodox and pretty insane, but it works pretty well. Future is playful, upbeat, and happy on the chorus, and while his singing isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s better than the last two features he did. He sounds sort of like a bubblegum pop singer, which is a completely new and unorthodox sound for him, but it\u2019s cool. Future\u2019s bridge isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s still solid enough to get the job done. Young Thug\u2019s first verse is extremely unorthodox and experimental, but it\u2019s good with its excessive auto-tune use, constant flow-switching, and heavily melodic singing / rapping. Young Thug\u2019s vocals are evocative, emotional, and heavily melodic, which is the big thing that makes the verse good. Rick Ross' second verse was great, and 2 Chainz\u2019s third verse was very good despite a rough start with a weird flow. This song was definitely one of the more unorthodox songs on this album, but it ended up being one of the coolest songs.This album is definitely DJ Khaled\u2019s biggest statement, biggest argument for his position in the music industry, most ambitious and sprawling project, and most commercially successful album. The feature list on this album is absolutely insane. Based on who is on this album alone and not the quality of the feature performances, this album probably has the greatest feature list of all time. That\u2019s an ambitious claim, I know, but look at who he got on this album! Beyonc\u00e9 & JAY-Z, The Carters, kick this album off on the second track. Then it\u2019s Drake on the next song, Rihanna on the one after that, and Quavo & Lil Wayne on the song after that. Travis Scott is featured 4 times, Rick Ross is featured 4 times, Nicki Minaj is featured twice, Future is featured 5 times, and Migos is featured twice (Quavo is featured a total of three times overall). Not to mention single appearances from Big Sean, Nas, Alicia Keys, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Jadakiss, Pusha T, Fat Joe, Raekwon, Gucci Mane, Young Thug, and 2 Chainz. I mean, the only person I can think of who\u2019s in DJ Khaled\u2019s network who\u2019s missing from this album is Kendrick Lamar, and he showed up on the previous album Major Key on a song with Big Sean and Betty Wright, who is featured on one of the two interludes from this album. In short, DJ Khaled pulled out all the stops on this album to make it a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d list of hip-hop & R&B music. So how could an album that\u2019s too big to fail with the highest of high-ticket features be bad? It comes down to mainly three things: Bad production (i.e. beats), bad mixing and mastering, and phoned-in, half-baked feature performances. The beats on this album were atrocious whenever DJ Khaled & Danja teamed up. Despite Danja\u2019s great track record with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and JAY-Z, he completely failed when paired up with DJ Khaled. To be honest, whenever DJ Khaled was listed as a producer on any of these songs, the beat was garbage. There were only a few songs where that wasn\u2019t the case, and they were few and far between. DJ Khaled; in conjunction with producers like Danja, Cool N Dre, L.V.M., DJ Nasty, and 808 Ray; made some of the worst beats I\u2019ve ever heard on any album ever. It doesn\u2019t matter if you get Nas & Travis Scott on the same song, for example; if the beat is garbage, the whole song will suck. The mixing on this album was also laughably bad for an album with a multi-million dollar budget. It\u2019s as if the mixing engineer on about half of this album\u2019s songs turned up the volume all the way on the vocals and beat and said to DJ Khaled: \u201cTrust me, bro, this is gonna sound great.\u201d In reality, that mixing resulted in some of the loudest, graniest, and most obnoxious songs of all time. I had the volume on lower than normal in my headphones, and the songs still sounded loud. Good songs that had either good verses or average beats would be completely ruined by bad mixing; a perfect example would be the collab with Jadakiss & Pusha T, which was completely screwed over by mixing issues. The final issue with this album resided in the performances from the featured artists. The entire first 10 songs of this album can be completely eliminated, as they all suck because of a combination of these three things. When the featured artists don\u2019t want to be on your song, or their verses are taken from other songs with different beats, the songs just don\u2019t sound good. Travis Scott & Future probably got worn out from featuring 4 and 5 times on this album, respectively, so they started phoning in their performances, and it showed massively. Uninventive choruses, uninspired vocals, and bad lyrics plagued a lot of this album, and it was especially common from artists like Rick Ross, Travis Scott & Future who had multiple appearances on this album. Nicki Minaj is the exception to that rule, though, as the two features she dropped on this album were both incredibly good and some of the best ones on the project. The only two 10s on this album, \u201cDon\u2019t Quit (with Calvin Harris feat. Jeremih & Travis Scott)\u201d and \u201cMajor Bag Alert (feat. Migos),\u201d were not even supposed to be on this album. The former was intended for Calvin Harris' Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 before DJ Khaled purchased it from him, and the latter was intended for Migos' Culture, but was replaced with \u201cCulture (feat. DJ Khaled)\u201d instead. I\u2019ve gotta give DJ Khaled some credit, though, as songs like \u201cBilly Ocean (feat. Fat Joe & Raekwon)\u201d & \u201cWhatever (feat. Future, Rick Ross, Young Thug & 2 Chainz)\u201d were good songs intended for this project specifically. However, 2 purchased 10s and 2 great originals is not gonna get it done for a 22-track double album. The cohesion that existed on Major Key was completely absent on this album, and DJ Khaled showed on here why he doesn\u2019t produce any of his songs anymore.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released October 28, 2014Genres: Pop, Shoegaze, Elegant Pop, Indie (Singer-Songwriter)Tracks:Heartstrings \u2013 9.2Run Away \u2013 9.4Good For One Thing \u2013 6.8Sweet \u2013 9.6On My Side \u2013 10L.A. \u2013 8.6Dreaming \u2013 9.7Blue Afternoon \u2013 7.7Entitled \u2013 10Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cHeartstrings\u201d: This song is absolutely insane. I can\u2019t believe that Leighton Meester, better known as Blair Waldorf from the TV show Gossip Girl (a TV show of which I\u2019m a huge fan), is not only a singer, but a singer who makes dream pop shoegaze music. I discovered both the genre of shoegaze and the TV show Gossip Girl in 2023, and now they\u2019re converging on an album released in 2014 by the TV show\u2019s third biggest character, behind only Serena van der Woodsen played by Blake Lively and Dan Humphrey played by Penn Badgley. This song is dreamy, it\u2019s light, it\u2019s ethereal, and it\u2019s airy in its sound. The acoustic guitar melody on here reminds me of the outro from the shoegaze band Slowdive\u2019s 1993 album Souvlaki \u201cDagger,\u201d except for that this acoustic guitar melody is better, more distorted, and dreamier. The acoustic guitar melody is the main part of the track, undoubtedly, but the rest of the song focuses on the wall of sound production that shoegaze and dream pop frequently employ. The drum pattern is heavily reverbed, the acoustic guitar melody is spacey, and the other instruments blend together for a wall of sound behind Leighton Meester\u2019s voice. This song also samples a flanged guitar riff from Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cBreathe (In The Air)\u201d! How epic is that? The production on this song is amazing, as the heavily reverbed drums, Pink Floyd sample electric guitar, and acoustic guitar melody come together perfectly in the wall of sound production to create an amazing dream pop soundscape. However, Leighton Meester falters with her vocals a few times on this song. The chorus probably has her best vocal performance, but parts of the verses could\u2019ve been better both vocally and lyrically. This song is about a breakup where Leighton\u2019s ex-boyfriend (most likely Sebastian Stan, also known as the MCU\u2019s Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier) manipulated her, she dumped him, and now he wants her back, but Leighton conveys that subject with varying degrees of success on here. The last verse is the best one, as Leighton makes an argument for the song being elegant pop with the vocals on there, but the other verses just weren\u2019t on that same level. However, this song was great and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing more of the album.\u201cRun Away\u201d: Yet again, Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl impresses me with her ability to make great shoegaze dream pop music. The wall of sound production is even more apparent on this song than it was on the last one, and the acoustic guitar melody on this track is just as good as it was on the last track if not better. The flanger effect is used in its full capacity on some of the acoustic guitar riffs, and it sounds very cool. The drums blend into the wall of sound on this track, and the distortion and dreaminess of Leighton Meester\u2019s vocals defines this track as shoegaze. The chorus on this song is spectacular, as the vocal layering, vocal performance from Leighton, flanged acoustic guitar, and good lyrics come together amazingly for a great chorus. Unfortunately, Leighton falters again on the two verses on this track. The first and second verses are solid, but they\u2019re nowhere near as good as the chorus, and the chorus blows them out of the water. The lyrics on this song about wanting to run away from problems and into the past is about as dreamy and spacey as Leighton\u2019s vocals and the wall of sound dream pop production, so it works really well. Overall, I\u2019d say this song is a second straight W for Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl. It\u2019s crazy to finally find an actor whose transition to music was not a terrible decision.\u201cGood For One Thing\u201d: Pretty generic indie pop country song where Leighton\u2019s Southern accent comes out pretty prominently and she starts to sound like Marren Morris on the verses and especially on the chorus. The acoustic guitar on this track is the same one that\u2019s used on Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cDarling I\u2019m A Mess,\u201d which came out on her debut album Eyes Wide Open in 2015, a year after this album was released. Lyrics are not very good, vocals aren\u2019t great either, and the production is somewhat shoddy on this song. Let\u2019s hope Leighton abandons this style and continues with dream pop after this one.\u201cSweet\u201d: It\u2019s amazing that a song like this one could be on the same album as a song like a generic indie pop country like \u201cGood For One Thing.\u201d The production on this song is outstanding, as the blend of a reverbed and dreamy acoustic guitar melody with a flanged electric guitar melody that sounds like it was done by Slowdive is absolutely amazing. The drums are heavily reverbed and filtered as well; it sounds like guitarist Christian Savill and drummer Simon Scott from Slowdive got together and produced this track for Leighton Meester. The production doesn\u2019t lean as heavily into the wall of sound that often characterizes shoegaze on this track as it did on some of the previous songs, but this one definitely has multiple instruments creating a complex soundscape. Leighton Meester shines on the chorus with her vocals and lyrics, but the first two verses aren\u2019t as good as they should\u2019ve been lyrically or vocally, and the pre-chorus isn\u2019t good or necessary either. Leighton definitely understands dream pop, though, and that\u2019s extremely evident on the chorus, as she does the ethereal and dreamy singing so well there. Leighton Meester obviously took inspiration from Slowdive\u2019s Rachel Goswell and Beach House\u2019s Victoria LeGrand on this song, and she did both of them justice, especially with her amazing chorus.\u201cOn My Side\u201d: An absolutely amazing song. This song has Leighton Meester\u2019s best vocals out of any song on the album, her best lyrics (she talks about how she would be a better lover for a guy she has a crush on than the girl he\u2019s currently with), and probably the best production as well. The production on this song is absolutely amazing, as this track takes some of the best elements from Slowdive\u2019s Souvlaki album (the flanged electric guitar melody is blissful, the powerful yet subdued drums are great, and some of the riffs are even sampled from Slowdive\u2019s \u201cMachine Gun\u201d) and combines them with some of the best elements of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Eyes Wide Open album (the \u201cdoe-eyed soul\u201d lyrics and vocals of Leighton Meester as well as the subtle acoustic guitar chords in the background). Leighton is gonna have a hard time topping this song, as it has her best vocals and lyrics and combines them with top-tier production.\u201cL.A.\u201d: A solid fusion of elegant pop and dream pop from Leighton Meester on this song. This track includes elements of the dream pop shoegaze style Leighton has been cultivating on this album such as the flanged guitar and reverbed drums, but this album truly wouldn\u2019t do Leighton\u2019s iconic character Blair Waldorf justice without having a few touches of elegant pop, now would it? This track includes some smooth, sultry vocals about love and wanting to start a new relationship with a lover in Los Angeles (Leighton beckons him with the line \u201cWon\u2019t you come sometime?\u201d) and production that also includes orchestral-sounding synths and even some violins in the style of Justin Timberlake & Timbaland on The 20/20 Experience Parts 1 and 2. This track isn\u2019t as good as some of the others because the lyrics aren\u2019t great, the vocals are hit and miss, and the production fusing elegant and dream pop can become muddied sometimes, but overall, it\u2019s a solid track.\u201cDreaming\u201d: A perfect title for a song on a dream pop album. This track is a far more successful fusion of dream pop and elegant pop than its precursor, as the grandiose string instrumentation on this song matches up perfectly with the heavy reverb acoustic guitar and subtle yet trippy drum pattern. The chorus is the strongest part of the song, as Leighton belts out an impassioned \u201cI\u2019m only dreaming\u201d surrounded by great lyrics and evocative vocals. The subject matter of this song focuses on Leighton being in denial about a relationship ending and deciding that she had dreamt the whole thing, and while it\u2019s a great concept, it doesn\u2019t always come through on the verses. The verses are good but not great, as Leighton sometimes stumbles with lyrics and vocals on them, but she\u2019s much more consistent on those parts than she had been previously. It\u2019s definitely another great track and a testament to how great fusions of elegant pop and dream pop can be if they\u2019re done well.\u201cBlue Afternoon\u201d: I\u2019m a big fan of the bass guitar melody on this song that carries the track, as well as the flanged electric guitar riffs that accompany that melody. Those are both amazing parts of the production on this track. Unfortunately, when it comes to Leighton Meester\u2019s vocals and lyrics on this song, the track sounds like a Lana Del Rey rip-off. I think Leighton Meester makes better music than Lana Del Rey just based on what I\u2019ve heard from her on this album and what I\u2019ve heard from Lana Del Rey over time, so why is Leighton trying to rip off Lana Del Rey with this mid dream pop song here? This song sounds disingenuous and unflattering for Leighton, but it\u2019s still almost good because Leighton does an alright at best job with lyrics and vocals and the production is pretty good as well.\u201cEntitled\u201d: What a perfect way to end the album. Leighton Meester gave some of her best vocals and lyrics on this song, and while the production didn\u2019t have the same wall of sound qualities it had on some of the previous tracks on this album, it was amazing nonetheless, as the production featured a few flanged guitar riffs along with a quirky synth chord progression and some synth bass that really made the track incredible. The chorus on this song was amazingly good, and Leighton built up to it brilliantly with a pre-chorus that had a totally different sound and used a totally different register of her vocal range, but the juxtaposition of the pre-chorus and chorus really made all the difference, as the chorus stood out that much more. This song was the perfect outro for this album, and Leighton Meester blew me away with how awesome this album was.Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that Leighton Meester, Gossip Girl\u2019s Blair Waldorf, would make her debut album a shoegaze dream pop album, and that it would be really good! This album only has two bad songs on it, and most of the tracks on here are above 9! This album sounds like what would happen if Slowdive, Justin Timberlake, and Sabrina Carpenter during her Disney Channel era got together to make an album. This album drew massive inspiration from the shoegaze band Slowdive, as many of the guitar tones on this album echoed those on Slowdive\u2019s genre-defining 1993 album Souvlaki, and Leighton Meester even went as far as to sample Slowdive\u2019s \u201cMachine Gun\u201d on one of the tracks on this album. The title track and intro also samples Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cBreathe (In The Air),\u201d and while that song isn\u2019t shoegaze, the flanged guitar riff that\u2019s sampled was easily converted into a shoegaze riff. This album also drew subtle inspiration from Justin Timberlake\u2019s The 20/20 Experience, as some of the elegant pop tracks on this album were like dream pop mixed with The 20/20 Experience Lite, as most of the heavier, sultry, smooth, and seductive elements of JT\u2019s genre-defining album didn\u2019t come through on this album. This album also sounded somewhat like Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Eyes Wide Open, which wouldn\u2019t be released until 2015, but her extended play Can\u2019t Blame A Girl For Trying (which contained about half of the Eyes Wide Open album) had been released at this point, so it\u2019s possible Leighton took some of the more \u201cdoe-eyed soul\u201d elements of this album from an early teenage Sabrina Carpenter. Leighton Meester\u2019s voice is perfect for dream pop, as she hit choruses on this album perfectly and while some of her verses weren\u2019t incredible, she was carried by production when she needed to be. It\u2019s incredible because Leighton Meester might be a better artist than she is an actress. I\u2019m not a fan of her character Blair Waldorf on Gossip Girl, so that might be skewing my perception of her, but she\u2019s an incredible artist. I never would\u2019ve guessed that her talents would be used in the same genre that artists like Slowdive and Beach House operate in, though. I only wish Leighton Meester would release a follow-up album to this debut album, as I\u2019d love to hear more of her elegant dream pop, especially now that Sabrina Carpenter and Slowdive have released new music she can draw inspiration from. A stellar debut album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 15, 2023Genres: Emo, Punk, Pop Rock, PopTracks:Heart Attack (Rock Version) \u2013 8Confident (Rock Version) \u2013 5.8Sorry Not Sorry (Rock Version) (feat.

It\u2019s definitely one of my all-time favorite Demi Lovato songs and it\u2019s a pop banger with amazing lyrics and vocals. Now, if this song had been Demi\u2019s Version of \u201cHeart Attack\u201d and it had been a pop song, this song would\u2019ve undoubtedly been a 10. Demi Lovato\u2019s mature and deeper register vocals on this version are actually better than they were on the original, and that\u2019s saying something because the original was a masterpiece with vocals. Demi Lovato threw in more minor vocal inflections and hit more notes on certain parts with this song than she did on the original, and not only was it impressive, it added more emotion and nuance to the song. Lyrics are great, but I knew that already because the lyrics on the original version were great. Although Demi Lovato dazzles with her vocals and evocative performance, why did it have to be an emo punk pop rock song? This song sounds like what would happen if Olivia Rodrigo was a good singer and songwriter. The production on this song is straight up shameless emo pop punk garbage, as it sounds like something blink-182\u2019s Travis Barker would produce for Trippie Redd, Avril Lavigne, Machine Gun Kelly, or even Olivia Rodrigo if they ever got the chance to work together (let\u2019s hope that never happens). At points on this instrumental, I expected Machine Gun Kelly to come on and scream in his cringy \u201cpunk rockstar\u201d voice \u201cI fell in love with an emo girl.\u201d It\u2019s such an absolute garbage beat, but the original song is amazing, so it sort of cancels out to a score at the very top of mid.\u201cConfident (Rock Version)\u201d: Just like with the first song, let\u2019s get something straight. \u201cConfident\u201d is a 10: an amazing get-up-and-go anthem track that\u2019s a pop banger that shows off Demi Lovato\u2019s lyrical and vocal talents equally. That song is amazing, and while Demi Lovato may have improved vocally on the rock version of \u201cHeart Attack\u201d that came before this song, the same can\u2019t be said for her vocals on this track. With this song, the only thing I\u2019m confident in is that Demi Lovato stole the guitar riffs on this beat from an AC/DC song. The riffs sound like a poor and cheap imitation of some of the best songs from the Australian heavy metal / hard rock band AC/DC, and they don\u2019t work well at all with this song. Demi Lovato\u2019s vocals on this song sound squeaky, pitchy, and insecure, as if she\u2019s trying too hard to sing at the same level she did the original song at. She comes off vocally as \u201ctry-harding\u201d on this song, and it ends up sounding disingenuous and weird. The rock vocal distortions don\u2019t work well on this song either, as Demi\u2019s voice just sounds weird, and this song ends up sounding less tough and hard than the pop version because of bad production and bad vocals. Not a good showing at all from Demi Lovato on this song.\u201cSorry Not Sorry (Rock Version) (feat. Slash)\u201d: Unlike the previous two songs that got remixed and turned into rock songs, the original version of \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d was already mid at best, so a rock version of this song could only make it go downhill. The original song had bad lyrics, mid flows, and mid vocals, and this song takes everything that was mid and makes it bad. The vocals on this song suck (especially the distorted metal scream after Demi Lovato\u2019s very basic \u201cedgy\u201d pop lyrics on her verses), the terrible nature of the lyrics is accentuated by how terrible the production, vocals, and flows are, and while Demi Lovato doesn\u2019t sound reluctant to curse like she did on the original version, her flows are still disjointed and her cursing comes off sound soft and uninspired (as if it\u2019s just filler to shock the fans). The instrumental is more basic emo pop punk production that sounds like a rejected blink-182 demo, and while the guitar solo from legendary Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash is good, it\u2019s out of place on this song and sounds disingenuous and weird mixed with Demi Lovato\u2019s bad singing and bad lyrics. Slash has worked with a ton of different artists; everyone from his original band Guns N' Roses to Michael Jackson to Rihanna, so he clearly is a respected and influential guitarist (as he should be regarded since he\u2019s very good). Why did he feel the need to feature on this terrible track then? His guitar solo was the best part, but even still, he should know better than to do a feature for a rock remix of a mid Demi Lovato song.\u201cCool For The Summer (Rock Version)\u201d: I\u2019m astonished to say it, but this song is better than the original version of \u201cCool For The Summer.\u201d I thought \u201cCool For The Summer\u201d would be the least likely song of Demi Lovato\u2019s to work better as a rock song, but it actually works much better as a rock song. The guitar riffs from the original song are more pronounced and grainy, which actually makes them sound more polished and more impactful for the song, if you can believe it. The verses and Demi Lovato\u2019s vocals on them are more tasteful, more sultry, and just all-around better than the original song, and though the chorus might be the only part that\u2019s weaker than the original song, Demi Lovato still does a great job with it. This song doesn\u2019t sound nearly as much like emo pop punk as the first few tracks did, and it\u2019s much better for it, as this track sounds more like how pop rock should sound. I didn\u2019t think it was possible, but Demi Lovato made a better version of \u201cCool For The Summer\u201d by leaning further into rock for it.\u201cNeon Lights (Rock Version) (with The Maine)\u201d: Out of everything I\u2019ve heard on this album so far, this song is the one that sounds the least like the original. \u201cNeon Lights\u201d was a pretty good Demi Lovato song and a mild commercial hit for her, but part of its appeal was its roots in synthpop and electronic music. Essentially, this song is Demi Lovato singing the lyrics to \u201cNeon Lights\u201d (which are pretty basic and don\u2019t have much to them) with mid flows and mid vocals on an instrumental where The Maine are doing whatever they want with raucous guitars, fast-paced and off-beat drums, and weird noises to amplify the \u201calternative rock\u201d sound that they\u2019re trying to go for with this track. The chorus sounds completely different and is devoid of anything that once made it good, and when The Maine\u2019s frontman started singing on the second verse, that\u2019s when I knew the original song had been completely destroyed in this new version. After the second to last chorus, the song drags on for another useless minute where The Maine continues with pointless, loud, and distorted guitar melodies, weird and fast drums that are just fast for the sake of being fast, and a general disregard for what the original song was supposed to sound like. A total and complete L for Demi Lovato that took a good song and made it a garbage one.\u201cLa La Land (Rock Version) (feat. Nina Strauss)\u201d: Guitarist Nina Strauss single-handedly prevents this song from being rated lower with her two shredding guitar solos that are brief but pack a powerful punch. She was Alice Cooper\u2019s lead guitarist on his most recent tour and rose to popularity in an Iron Maiden tribute band, so it\u2019s clear she knows how to shred on the guitar. She did all she could on this song to make it better than it was, but essentially, this song was just boring, contrived, emo pop punk guitar riffs and loud emo pop punk drums, so there wasn\u2019t much room for Nina Strauss to work. She put in those guitar solos where she could, but they didn\u2019t really make an impact because of how bad the song was. The original track is one of Demi Lovato\u2019s most corny, cringy, Disney Channel emo pop punk, \u201cI\u2019m not like other girls\u201d songs she\u2019s ever released, and this new version of that song was essentially Demi Lovato turning up the volume and making the guitar riffs louder and more obnoxious than they were on the original song. With lyrics like \u201cI\u2019m not a supermodel / I still eat McDonald\u2019s,\u201d and \u201cWho said I can\u2019t wear my /  Converse with my dress,\u201d it\u2019s impossible not to cringe and see how bad the songwriting is on this track. To be honest, the Nina Strauss guitar solos might\u2019ve improved this song mildly, as the original version might\u2019ve been worse than this version since it lacked them. An absolute and total failure.\u201cGive Your Heart A Break (Rock Version) (with Bert McCracken)\u201d: \u201cGive Your Heart A Break\u201d is one of my favorite Demi Lovato songs and a beautiful track where Demi dazzles with vocals, lyrics, and flows and gives an emotional performance. However, this version, which features Bert McCracken, the lead singer of the cringy and bad alternative rock band The Used, absolutely tarnishes and completely destroys the legacy of that amazing song. The vocals from Demi Lovato are horrendously awful, the flows on the verses completely destroy the emotion from the original song, and the production is the most contrived, unoriginal, bland, and banal emo pop punk instrumentation of all time. Bert McCracken attempting to sing the second verse and harmonize with Demi on the chorus was a horrifically bad decision, and his performance was straight cringe. This song sounded like a Machine Gun Kelly cover of Demi Lovato\u2019s \u201cGive Your Heart A Break\u201d produced by Travis Barker. What a terrible and astonishingly bad failure.Well, here\u2019s a remix album from Demi Lovato that no one wanted or asked for. Since 2020, the \u201cemo pop punk-ification\u201d of pop music has been an extreme issue that continues to run rampant to this day. This trend was started by Travis Barker when he started producing for and collaborating with artists like Machine Gun Kelly, blackbear, Trippie Redd, HUDDY, and others, and since Travis Barker\u2019s emo pop punk renaissance started in 2020, he\u2019s only gone out to inspire more artists to participate in this genre. Almost every TikToker who wants to be a singer has adopted that genre as their musical style, and artists like Tate McRae, Olivia Rodrigo, and those I already mentioned have pushed emo pop punk to become the dominant style in the music industry. Demi Lovato jumped on this bandwagon on 2021 with her album HOLY FVCK (probably her worst album of all time), and it seems as though she\u2019s fully buying into the \u201cemo pop punk-ification\u201d of pop music by remixing all of her old commercial hits with new \u201crock versions.\u201d Now, this album actually had a few surprises, as \u201cCool For The Summer (Rock Version)\u201d was actually better than the original version of \u201cCool For The Summer,\u201d amazingly, as I thought that song would never work as a rock song, but it ended up being better with rock than it was with pop. \u201cHeart Attack (Rock Version)\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly good, but Demi Lovato\u2019s vocals on that song were amazing and made me think about how good the song would be if Demi had simply re-recorded it and not tried to make it into a rock song. However, the pleasant surprises with this album ended there. Demi Lovato got a feature from Slash on this album, who is one of the greatest living guitarists at the moment (along with David Gilmour, Peter Frampton, and Kirk Hammett), and completely fumbled it by putting him on a remix of the lame and mid \u201cSorry Not Sorry.\u201d Most of these songs, especially the tracks from Demi Lovato\u2019s albums Don\u2019t Forget and Unbroken did not make for convincing rock songs at all, and thus, they sounded completely terrible. Demi Lovato\u2019s features from alternative rock artists The Maine and Bert McCracken of The Used made this album sound like a blackbear or Trippie Redd album produced by Travis Barker, or even Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s ridiculously inconsistent Pink Tape album. The ridiculousness of these features was shown especially when alternative rock dudes started singing Demi Lovato lyrics, and it just did not work at all. This album was a complete miss and a total joke of a project that shows just how hard Demi Lovato is trying (and failing) to stay relevant.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 18, 2023Genres: Disco, Synthpop, PopTracks:Probl\u00e9matique \u2013 7.8Je T'Adore \u2013 8.2All She Wants (feat.

This album was supposed to be Kim Petras' debut album, but it was shelved in favor of her other 2023 album Feed The Beast, so I\u2019m interested to see if this album tops that one. With this song, it\u2019s definitely starting out bolder and more defined than Feed The Beast did. The verses and lyrics on the verses are bland, flavorless, and mid, as if Kim Petras is trying too hard to be an apathetic diva and not putting any effort into her lyrics or vocals. The chorus is average at best, as there are some parts where Kim Petras sounds like Sabrina Carpenter (on the sultry backing vocals given on the post-chorus where Kim sings in a lower register than she\u2019s used to while overdubbing it with a higher falsetto) and others where she sounds like Teezo Touchdown (the climactic \u201caah, woo!\u201d part on the main chorus sounds like Teezo Touchdown was meant to do it in his cringy Disney Channel-ified voice). The production on this song is disco-infused, which is a great sound for Kim Petras because it fits her vocals and personality perfectly, but this particular beat sounds like a lazy and stripped-down version of Madonna\u2019s \u201cVogue\u201d that doesn\u2019t have any real flavor to it. Why would I listen to this song when I could listen to any of Madonna\u2019s disco-infused songs? This track begs that question. Not an incredible start for Kim Petras, but not a terrible one either.\u201cJe T'Adore\u201d: The chorus on this song is great; Kim Petras' vocals are evocative, emotional, sweet, and some of her best I\u2019ve heard on the album thus far. The lyrics on the chorus are very good as well, as Kim Petras expresses her love for her boyfriend and tells him she wants to be his everything and love him \u201cmore than anybody before.\u201d Great chorus, but everything else on the song is mid. The verses are repetitive and flavorless, as Kim Petras resorts to cringy and corny sex metaphors like \u201cGot the cake, Marie Antoinette.\u201d The production is mid as well, as the entire song is built around a synth chord progression with only two chords, and the drums are hollow and barely noticeable throughout the song. That chorus, as well as the bridge that\u2019s very similar to the chorus and has great vocals and lyrics from Kim, is just enough to push this song into the good category, but it\u2019s barely enough.\u201cBorn Again\u201d: This song is absolutely amazing! The production on this song is top-tier disco, as it sounds like this song was produced by Nile Rodgers for his 70\u2019s disco band Chic or for Madonna. The funky bassline, poppy synth chords, and consistent drums make this beat an epic disco anthem, and Kim Petras takes full advantage of the great production on here. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the chorus because of its lyrics and how weird it is, but the verses are impeccable. Kim Petras gushes about a connection she feels with a guy on the verses, and her vocals are smooth, sultry, evocative, and emotionally charged. This song is great and it really shows how much potential Kim Petras over disco instrumentals has. I hope there are quite a few more songs like this one on this album.\u201cSomething About U\u201d: Kim Petras just put out back-to-back bangers that show why disco and post-disco is the perfect sound for her vocals, lyrics, and overall style. This song has silky, ethereal, and great vocals from Kim Petras, lyrics about being madly in love and comparing the connection to floating in space and flying around in a spaceship, and a psychedelic disco instrumental that complements the space theme of this track perfectly with its spacey synth melody, funky disco bassline, and ethereal synth chords. Kim Petras' vocals sound awesome on this song, and not only does she sound smitten as she gushes about her boyfriend, but she also sounds the best vocally she\u2019s sounded so far on this album. I\u2019m hoping this hot streak continues because Kim is on a heater right now.\u201cConfession\u201d: The subject matter of this song, which is Kim Petras longing to be with a guy and confessing her love for him along with everything she would do if he was her boyfriend, is great and it\u2019s textbook Kim Petras, but the lyrics and vocals on here are not good. The disco production on this song is a bit lazy and sounds like a watered-down and diluted version of Nicki Minaj\u2019s electronic disco banger \u201cStarships,\u201d but it\u2019s still an alright beat (the bass is not prominent enough and the melody is just a bargain-brand version of Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cStarships\u201d). The chorus is mid, as Kim\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t good and her flow is off as well, and though the first verse is good, the second one is mid because Kim starts throwing out some vulgar innuendos that distract from the subject matter and take the song in the direction most of the tracks on her album Slut Pop did (Slut Pop is hands-down one of the worst albums I\u2019ve ever heard). Mid song.\u201cDirty Things\u201d: The production on this song is good but nothing special, and Kim Petras tries her best to sound like Madonna & Ariana Grande with her vocals on this track (undoubtedly two of her idols, as those two are incredible pop superstars who are extremely influential). The verses are mid on this track because the vocals are bland, boring, and rather uninspired, and the lyrics are similarly banal and flavorless. The main thing that gets this song above mid is the chorus, where Kim Petras stretches her vocal range to new heights and sings in an unbelievably high falsetto voice that ends up sounding very good. Her vocals and lyrics are very good on the chorus, but unfortunately, the average and lackluster production and the mid vocals and lyrics on the verses bring this song down. Fortunately, the chorus was enough to boost it into the 8-9 range, but it barely is over the mid threshold.\u201cLove Ya Leave Ya\u201d: Good but not great. The instrumental on this song is post-disco mixed with French EDM / house music, and it offers an odd but very good mix of styles that makes for a great beat. The accordion melody is a bit odd to begin the song, but the pulsating drums with the funky disco bassline work very well in conjunction with it. The chorus from Kim Petras is good, as she talks about being between a rock and a hard place in her relationship, and she handles the juxtaposition of wanting to love and wanting to leave her boyfriend very well on that chorus. However, the verses are lacking in creativity, lyrical depth, and good vocals. Kim Petras' lyrics, vocals, and flows on the verses are incredibly half-baked and phoned-in, and once again, Kim relies on the strength of the chorus and the production to push her through. This song is good, and while it doesn\u2019t work well as an outro track, it\u2019s emblematic of some of the major problems with this album.September 15, 2023 has been one of the oddest New Music Fridays in recent history. The two biggest artists to drop new music, Nas & Hit-Boy with Magic 3 that now engages in a three-way tie for the second best album of 2023 and Kim Petras with her shelved disco-infused album Probl\u00e9matique, both did not drop on Friday. Nas & Hit-Boy released Magic 3 on Thursday, September 14, and Kim Petras released Probl\u00e9matique somewhat surprisingly on Monday, September 18. Don\u2019t they know we have football on those nights? Nevertheless, these two releases were undoubtedly the most high-profile of the week, so I wanted to hear them as soon as possible. Probl\u00e9matique was supposed to be released in 2022 as Kim Petras' official debut album (which is very weird considering this album is now Kim Petras' fourth album following ERA 1 [her somewhat unofficial debut album], Clarity, and Feed The Beast), but it\u2019s now the follow-up to Feed The Beast, her other 2023 album. The timing of this album\u2019s release is puzzling to say the least, as Kim Petras' Feed The Beast came out less than three months ago in June of 2023, but I\u2019m not gonna complain about more new music. With this album, it\u2019s clear disco is Kim Petras' best genre. She\u2019s tried hyperpop, bubblegum bass, and various styles of synthpop, but disco is where it\u2019s at for her. The disco production on this album with its funky basslines, lush synth chords, and danceable synth melodies, was a perfect complement to Kim Petras' glamorous and glitzy popstar princess diva personality, but unfortunately, the true potential of this album was only realized on two tracks: \u201cBorn Again\u201d & \u201cSomething About U.\u201d Those songs showed the true potential of Kim Petras on disco songs, as they had excellent vocals and lyrics from Kim on top of great production. While Kim Petras has a few other good songs on this album, she mostly relied on the strength her choruses and the disco production to push her through on this album. \u201cTreat Me Like A Ho\u201d sounds like an abysmal omission from Kim\u2019s Slut Pop project, and the Paris Hilton collab \u201cAll She Wants (feat. Paris Hilton)\u201d featured some terrible vocals from Paris Hilton, trash lyrics from both of them, and bad production that was overly repetitive and listless. Songs like \u201cJe T'Adore,\u201d \u201cDirty Things,\u201d and \u201cLove Ya Leave Ya\u201d were perfect examples of Kim doing just enough to get by on the verses while her choruses and the production were the main strengths of the song. The title track and intro track \u201cProbl\u00e9matique\u201d was also an example of that paradigm. Kim Petras sounded amazing when she was focused and gave great lyrics and vocals to fully fulfill her great subject matters about love and blossoming crushes on this album, but when she phoned in performances or completely went off the rails, she crashed and burned. Two tracks above 9 on an album where there should\u2019ve been at least six songs above 9 is undoubtedly a disappointment.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 14, 2023Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Boom BapTracks:Fever \u2013 9.9TSK \u2013 10Superhero Status \u2013 8.4I Love This Feeling \u2013 9.6No Tears \u2013 7.5Never Die (feat.

What an incredible way to start this album. This album was released on Nas' 50th birthday: September 14, 2023, and he clearly wants everyone to know that he\u2019s 50 years old and there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s still a relevant, popular hip-hop artist who can go toe-to-toe with anyone in the rap game. The production from Hit-Boy on this song is incredible: it\u2019s elegant, grandiose, triumphant, and includes a 70\u2019s soul sample. In short, this beat sounds like something that Nas would\u2019ve rapped on in the 90\u2019s on an album like Illmatic, It Was Written, or I Am\u2026. Speaking of Illmatic, this song includes a very well-placed sample from Nas' 1994 Illmatic song \u201cRepresent,\u201d where he samples the chorus from that song on this one. The sample is absolutely brilliant; the chorus sounds as good if not better on this song than it does on the original, and Nas is obviously showing how far he\u2019s come in the hip-hop industry, but making one thing clear: He\u2019s still very much the guy who made Illmatic and so many other great albums. The lyrics on this song sound like a victory lap, as if Nas is throwing a birthday party for himself on this track with the most swagger, elegance, and sophistication he possibly can. He shouts out his own achievements, shouts out the people who have always stayed with him, comments on his status and his legacy, and basically says \u201cI\u2019m still him at 50 years old\u201d for the entire song, and it\u2019s awesome. The production from Hit-Boy on this song is better than anything on Magic 2, and even most of King\u2019s Disease III. Hit-Boy definitely stepped up on this track, and Nas did as well. The only bad part of the track is the outro: the humming didn\u2019t fit with the rest of the song, so a single point is taken off for that. Amazing intro.\u201cTSK\u201d: \u201cYo, Hit, what time is it?\u201d Nas asks his producer after the first verse and chorus on this song. \u201cIt\u2019s showtime, bro,\u201d Hit-Boy replies, leading Nas to say, \u201cOh, yeah, that,\u201d and proceeding to spit the second verse. The production on this song from Hit-Boy is spectacular. A chopped-up dream pop vocal sample mixed with boom bap drums on the verses, mixed with a fully aggressive boom bap pattern on the chorus. Epic juxtaposition, and Nas sounds poised, triumphant, and combative on this song, basically issuing a warning to his haters, people who say he\u2019s fallen off, and people who say he\u2019s not the greatest. It\u2019s beats like this one that remind me why Hit-Boy is in my top 10 all-time GOAT producers list and verses like this that remind me why Nas is one of my all-time favorite rappers and artists. Nas does his thing so well on this track; flows are amazing, lyrics are great, and he sounds as focused and tuned in as he did on his first few albums. Amazing song.\u201cSuperhero Status\u201d: Not as good as the first two songs, but still a solid song. The first verse on this song is undoubtedly the best one, as the best lyrics and flow are on that verse, but the second and third verses aren\u2019t as good. The second one is good, but the third one is mid, as Nas starts spitting some weird lyrics and gets off the beat a few times because he\u2019s trying to make certain lyrics work with a weird flow that doesn\u2019t accommodate them. The production from Hit-Boy is good, as this song includes another chopped-up 70\u2019s soul sample, but the vocal sample, which sounds like it\u2019s saying \u201cit\u2019s the shadow,\u201d gets annoying after a while and becomes distracting, especially during Nas' third verse. Still no misses on the album up to this point, but this one was a bit of a drop in quality.\u201cI Love This Feeling\u201d: Another chopped-up 70\u2019s soul sample beat from Hit-Boy, and it\u2019s definitely better than the beat on \u201cSuperhero Status,\u201d but not quite as good as the opening beat on \u201cFever.\u201d The soul sample croons as Nas spits some great verses that deal with everything from his business acumen, to being \u201ca simp, a trick, or in love with your own d***\u201d (a great line which Nas follows up by saying \u201ceach one of them distractions,\u201d as he\u2019s advocating for being a good man and not a simp, a man-whore, or an incel), to having Illmatic featured in an episode of Ozark (which he follows up by saying \u201cit would feel better than if I had co-starred\u201d), to likening this album to It Was Written, to talking about the difference between guys in the park playing chess to guys in prison playing chess, which draws a great parallel between how they lived their lives. This track\u2019s lyrics are great, but Nas doesn\u2019t really get going until after the drums kick in on the first verse. The chorus is very good, though Nas' overuse of the title of the song can be a bit much. However, this song is a return to the quality of the first two tracks of this album.\u201cNever Die (feat. Lil Wayne)\u201d: I was really looking forward to hearing this song because it\u2019s a combination of two of my all-time favorite GOAT hip-hop artists with a top 10 all-time GOAT producer making a beat for them using a chopped-up 70\u2019s soul sample which I know Nas can do very well on since I\u2019ve heard him kill those beats time and time again. Unfortunately, this song was mid. The production from Hit-Boy was solid; not his best work, but not bad by any stretch of the imagination either; the soul-sample chop on this song was about equal to that of the one on \u201cSuperhero Status.\u201d The first verse from Nas started out very rocky with him saying \u201cwe ain\u2019t gon' never die,\u201d but cutting himself off every time, then launching into a boisterous verse that sounded like a dumbed-down version of everything he\u2019s been talking about thus far on this album. The chorus wasn\u2019t much better, and while Lil Wayne\u2019s verse was good, complete with references to Deion Sanders' coaching of his song and the Colorado football team, white blonde girls (always a W reference), and the line \u201cthese dudes need to catch up, they like Heinz,\u201d it wasn\u2019t nearly as good as it should\u2019ve been. I expected a great verse from Lil Wayne, especially since he was paired up with Nas, another legendary lyricist, but he was pretty average on this song. Not exactly what I wanted to hear from three GOATs.\u201cPretty Young Girl\u201d: Dang, this song had so much potential, but it was completely squandered by how trash the production from Hit-Boy was on this song. This beat is the first Hit-Boy L on this album. This beat sounds like something Hit-Boy would\u2019ve produced for Nas on the often inconsistent album King\u2019s Disease III, as it sort of reminds me of \u201cWTH SMH,\u201d except for that the lyrics on this song were pretty good. The chopped-up soul sample says \u201cit was a pretty young girl\u201d in a weird voice about every three seconds spliced throughout gaudy horns, and it sounds totally disingenuous and weird, especially considering how Nas is using this song to express his affections for a girl that he once knew. I love it when artists, especially people like Nas who often put out a hardened image, show their softer side and gush over their crushes, so it sucks that Nas didn\u2019t really get to do that on this song because the beat was garbage. The lyrics also degraded towards the end of the song, but the L on this track is mostly because of Hit-Boy\u2019s bad production.\u201cBased On True Events, Pt. 2\u201d: I realize that this song is another storytelling track from Nas (which are songs that I usually like, but these two songs both had mid lyrics and mid production, although the stories were gotten across pretty well, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of them and how they were delivered), but this track has a totally different story from \u201cBased On True Events.\u201d Both of these songs had lyrics that were only okay, and though the stories were gotten across pretty well, I wasn\u2019t a fan of some of Nas' delivery or his flows on these tracks, and on this song in particular, the computerized voice saying \u201cEnd of chapter 1\u2026 Chapter 2\u201d during the break (while Hit-Boy\u2019s production did some weird stuff that sounded like a reversed dream pop sample mixed with shoegaze) just sounded weird, sort of out-of-place, and off-putting on this song. Nas is a great storyteller, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind about that, but both songs in this series could\u2019ve been executed better.\u201cSitting With My Thoughts\u201d: Hit-Boy is back again with another extremely great beat! He had me worried for a few songs because I thought he had fallen off a bit, but this track, similar to this album\u2019s other 10 \u201cTSK,\u201d samples a dream pop song where not just the vocals are used, but the heavy reverb acoustic guitar is used as well. Nas' flow on this song is laid-back, low-key, and lo-fi to fit the mood of the beat, and he does an excellent job fitting that mood perfectly. Hit-Boy\u2019s production on this song is perfect, and the flanged organ chords on the outro were amazing as well; almost as if they were Hit-Boy\u2019s answer to MIKE DEAN\u2019s GOATed synth outros. On this song, Nas does exactly what the song\u2019s title implies: He sits with his thoughts. On this track, Nas raps about the death of Nipsey Hussle (even gives him a shout-out with a posthumous vocal sample), reflects on his come-up and who he used to look up to, and talks about how he assumed more responsibility as he got older. This track is just excellent in every way it can be, and it\u2019s a total reset and shift from the last few mid songs. Amazing track.\u201cJapanese Soul Bar\u201d: Two beat switches from Hit-Boy on this track: The song starts out with a chopped-up soul sample without vocals, which sounds amazingly good and Nas flows effortlessly over it with a first verse and first chorus that sounds like he doesn\u2019t even have to try to be good, he can just flow and start rapping and it\u2019ll sound great regardless. Nas' laid-back, lo-fi, low-key flow is perfect on this verse, and his lyrics about being the future of music in a time when Rick Rubin and grunge rock dominated the music industry was not only interesting, but it was a testament to how far he\u2019s come as an artist. The second beat is a jazzy saxophone beat which is extremely smooth and laid-back, and Nas continues to flow with ease on the second verse over this beat, even dropping a reference to Barry White and talking about who would play him (i.e. Nas) in a documentary about himself (i.e. Nas). The third beat after that is a jazzy piano beat with intermittent horns which sounds even smoother than the previous one and offers Nas a chance to relax even further as he delivers the last chorus before an interview clip from him rolls for the outro. What an amazing song; definitely could\u2019ve been a convincing outro, so I\u2019ll be eager to see what Nas & Hit-Boy do for the actual outro. \u201cKD3 had gold bars, these Vibranium, can\u2019t break\u201d was such a W line, always a W to reference Marvel and the MCU on a track.\u201c1-800-Nas&Hit\u201d: I\u2019m not sure that I like this song because it sounds like an announcement of retirement for the legendary rapper Nas. He takes a whole minute and a half at the end of the song to shout out everyone who was involved in the album process, and though he says \u201cLet us know when you want us back, and we\u2019ll come spin the block again\u201d during the outro sequence, I\u2019m not sure I believe him. The production from Hit-Boy on this track is not good, as the soul-sample chop is poorly executed and the chopped-up vocals are way too loud and badly mixed with Nas' verses. As for Nas' verses, they\u2019re very good, but they sound like a final victory lap, as if Nas wants to hang it up after he finishes this album\u2019s release. It\u2019s bittersweet, definitely, but I certainly hope Nas makes another triumphant return to music at some point. Hopefully next time, the producer he calls for a collab album series will be Metro Boomin.\u201cKD3 had gold bars, these Vibranium, can\u2019t break,\u201d Nas spits on the chorus of the soulful, jazzy, laid-back, low-key instrumental of \u201cJapanese Soul Bar,\u201d one of multiple 10s on this album. I certainly hope the rating reflects this claim because this album is my favorite of any of Nas & Hit-Boy\u2019s collab albums. Out of all of them: King\u2019s Disease (2020), King\u2019s Disease II (2021), Magic (2021), King\u2019s Disease III (2022), and Magic 2 (2023), Magic 3 tops all of them. Unfortunately, this album might be the last album ever for the 50-year-old legendary Queensbridge rapper Nas, but if it is, it\u2019s certainly a good note to retire on. This album had probably the best production from Hit-Boy from any of Nas & Hit-Boy\u2019s collab albums, as Hit-Boy was consistent and used nearly every tool at his disposal to chop up 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s soul tracks and dream pop songs for great beats for Nas. It was interesting to hear Nas rap on a chopped-up soul sample as he would\u2019ve done in the 90\u2019s on one track and then hear Nas rap on a dream pop sample on the next song, but Hit-Boy\u2019s great production and Nas' great rapping allowed for that paradigm to work. Although this album has smash hits and three 10\u2019s, it\u2019s not without its disappointments. Perhaps the album\u2019s biggest disappointment was the mid Lil Wayne collaboration, as I\u2019ve been wanting to hear those two legends on a track for a long time, but this song was unfortunately not up to the caliber either of them are used to performing at. The other disappointments included a massive Hit-Boy L on \u201cPretty Young Girl,\u201d where he completely botched the song with a crap sample, and both parts of \u201cBased On True Events,\u201d where Nas attempted his legendary storytelling but ultimately fell short. \u201cSpeechless, Pt. 2\u201d was a massive highlight, though, as that song showed just how much better this album is than Magic 1, where the original song \u201cSpeechless\u201d was (and was mid). If this album is Nas' final album before he hangs it up for good, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s this one. This album is the culmination of everything Nas & Hit-Boy have been working towards throughout the 2020s, and it\u2019s their most polished product. Unfortunately, the filler and sheer volume of mid tracks might make the album\u2019s overall rating dip a bit further down than it should.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 8, 2023Genres: Pop Rock, Punk, Art Rock, Art Pop, Emo, Avant-Garde & Experimental, Indie (Singer-Songwriter)Tracks:OK \u2013 0.1You Thought (feat.

This album was hyped up an insane amount for me because Drake said on his Instagram that this album was \u201csome of the best music [he\u2019d] ever heard,\u201d and although Teezo Touchdown\u2019s features on Travis Scott\u2019s UTOPIA and Don Toliver\u2019s Love Sick weren\u2019t anything special because both Travis & Don waxed him on those songs, I was impressed that he was able to get on those albums and hold his own relatively okay, especially since he\u2019s an indie artist. Now, with this intro track, it\u2019s possible that Teezo Touchdown is battling Olivia Rodrigo and her album GUTS to be the worst album dropped on September 8, 2023 with an opening song that sounds like it could\u2019ve been on Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s album. The lyrics on this song are unbelievably corny, cringy, dumb, and just straight up bad, as Teezo Touchdown delivers them in a vocal cadence that mixes Weezer\u2019s frontman Rivers Cuomo with Talking Heads' frontman David Byrne, and he just sounds straight up awful in this vocal cadence. The lyrics are like something I\u2019d find in a fake-depressed emo 15 year old boy\u2019s diary or on an album by Trippie Redd or Olivia Rodrigo (those are all the same thing, pretty much), but somehow cornier and more cringy. The guitar riffs are horribly bland and indicative of poorly produced pop rock and pop punk, and this track seriously sounds like it could\u2019ve taken the place of The Click Five\u2019s \u201cPop Princess\u201d on Hannah Montana\u2019s debut album as the worst track on that album. This song is unbelievably and unbearably bad and potentially one of the worst intro tracks of all time.\u201cYou Thought (feat. Janelle Mon\u00e1e)\u201d: The first part of the song is complete garbage. The pop punk instrumental (bland, stupid, dumb-sounding, loud guitar riffs) mixed with Teezo Touchdown\u2019s ridiculous, cringy, and corny lyrics and vocals makes for a trash first verse. The second part is mid at best, but it has some redeeming qualities. Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s very short but very sweet vocals are the best part of the song undoubtedly, as she absolutely waxes Teezo Touchdown on his own song despite having only four lines that she repeats twice. Teezo Touchdown has a few good lines on his two verses, and the one-man-choir effect he uses for his voice on the third verse was actually pretty cool, but everything else, especially his falsetto singing, the majority of his lyrics, and his deadpan vocal delivery, is all ridiculous and cringy. This song is bad and I\u2019m sorry that Janelle Mon\u00e1e had to be associated with it.\u201cUUHH\u201d: Weirdly romantic and euphemistically vulgar in a Teezo Touchdown kind of way. This song is about Teezo Touchdown trying to court a girl and trying to get her to have sex with him by appealing to her feelings. It\u2019s a very weird song and Teezo Touchdown\u2019s vocals are all over the place, and his lyrics are the same way, but in a way, it\u2019s sort of romantic? I\u2019m not sure, though. If I played this song for a girl in an intimate setting, she\u2019d leave immediately. The sexual grunting noises are way too much, and Teezo Touchdown trying to do an impersonation of Michael Jackson with his vocals on this song on an 80\u2019s inspired beat that blends post-punk sounds with New Order and Phil Collins type production is just very odd and too far out there. The production on this song is good, though, as the fusion of synthpop, post-punk, and soft rock really comes through strong on this beat.\u201cSweet (feat. Foushe\u00e9)\u201d: The mellow, laid-back, lo-fi, low-key production with a tropical-sounding piano melody and a sparse yet driving drum pattern is great, and the second verse from Foushe\u00e9 is very good, but yet again, Teezo Touchdown falls short because of how corny and cringy he is with his lyrics and vocal delivery. He will definitely be joining A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie in the list of \u201ccornball\u201d artists that I\u2019m starting. Teezo Touchdown tries to be romantic and gush over his girlfriend on this song, but he ends up sounding so weird because of his off-putting vocals and lyrics that are either creepy, weird, or emo. Foushe\u00e9 does a great job closing out the song, and if it had only been her on the song, this song could\u2019ve very well been in the 9-10 range, but Teezo Touchdown is yet again getting bodied on his own song because of how garbage he is.\u201cImpossible\u201d: If anyone thought this song would sound like Travis Scott\u2019s track from Rodeo of the same name, get that out of your head. This song is a bland, banal, contrived, trite, bubblegum, Disney Channel-ified pop rock song that actually manages to rip off Hannah Montana\u2019s \u201cWho Said\u201d in the process of being corny, cringy, weird, and just straight up dumb. Teezo Touchdown is trying to make everyone feel sorry for him by whining about how he never got any recognition and had to do all these things to get himself where he is, but it just comes off sounding disingenuous and forced because he doesn\u2019t sound like he actually believes what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s phoning in the vocals over some half-baked pop rock guitar that absolutely sucks. Another song that\u2019s terrible.\u201cNeighborhood\u201d: The funky bassline provided by the bass guitar on this track sounds like a great fusion of funk and disco, sort of like \u201cStayin' Alive\u201d by Bee Gees, and it\u2019s definitely the highlight of this beat. Production on this song is very good, and Teezo Touchdown for once sings and raps seriously and doesn\u2019t try to do a bunch of weird stuff on this track. The verses on this song are very good, as Teezo Touchdown describes his lifestyle of living in rough neighborhoods and on the street, and even being distanced from his family. The chorus can be a bit distracting and annoying at times, as Teezo Touchdown\u2019s singing is very campy and indicative of tongue-and-cheek pop rock, but other than that, it\u2019s pretty good. The smoke detector beeping effect on this song sounds incredibly realistic, though, and each time I heard it, I turned around to check my smoke detector. I\u2019m not a fan of sound effects like that in songs, mainly because they distract from the song itself and are just annoying. Overall, though, this song is a very solid track from Teezo Touchdown.\u201cMood Swings\u201d: Very cool funk instrumental with a great bassline and a solid drum pattern, but that\u2019s about the only thing about this song that\u2019s great. The verses are good at best, and the chorus is unbelievably cringy and corny, with Teezo Touchdown singing \u201cWee! Another mood swing\u201d in a high-pitched, childish, cringy, and corny voice that only continues to cement his status as a \u201ccornball\u201d artist. Now, in the middle of the song, the laid-back, low-key, driving funk instrumental devolves into a punk instrumental with loud guitar and raucous drums, where Teezo Touchdown gives a cringy metaphor of his mood \u201cmelt[ing] like ice cream\u201d before the song returns to its previous funk instrumental. If this beat had been used by anyone else (Funkadelic could\u2019ve worked wonders with it), the song probably would\u2019ve been good, but in this case, it\u2019s misused by a garbage artist.\u201cDaddy Mama Drama\u201d: Absolutely abysmal in every way it can possibly be. The lyrics, vocals, and flows on this song are laughably bad, almost as if Teezo Touchdown was trying to be intentionally cringe with them. His drawn-out delivery, corny and stupid metaphors that barely make any sense (the cliche expression \u201cthe apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree\u201d is flipped into talking about an Apple phone for some reason), bad lyrics, and apathetic vocal cadence sound like he\u2019s trying to imitate a bad emo pop band from the early 2000\u2019s, which is played up especially by the acoustic guitar instrumental. This song sounds like Teezo Touchdown took the worst elements of his influences and blended them together into one awful song.Teezo Touchdown. Probably one of the worst stage names I\u2019ve ever heard in my life, definitely down there with Doodie Lo and Bootie Brown. Teezo Touchdown initially emerged as a hip-hop artist with an avant-garde and experimental style, as he was given features on big-name albums by Tyler, The Creator, Don Toliver, and Travis Scott. Drake even co-signed this album, which normally implies that the genre of the album is hip-hop or R&B. Although I didn\u2019t like Teezo Touchdown\u2019s feature on Tyler, The Creator\u2019s CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST album in 2021, I enjoyed his 2023 features on Don Toliver\u2019s Love Sick and Travis Scott\u2019s UTOPIA. Even then, his style could be a bit off-putting, but great production and collabs with the GOATs Don Toliver & Travis Scott made him sound pretty good. With this album, I expected an experimental hip-hop album with a few R&B influences. However, that was not at all what this album was. The hip-hop influence was minimal and almost non-existent throughout this album. The big musical styles that were used were pop rock and punk, and they were both used in ways that made Teezo Touchdown sound like a bad, corny, and cringy version of bands like Green Day, Weezer, The All-American Rejects, blink-182, and Avril Lavigne for most of the album. There was some influence from post-punk artists like Talking Heads on this album as well, but that was few and far-between, as Teezo Touchdown only attempted (and failed) to sound like Talking Heads' David Byrne once or twice. The one good song on this album was \u201cNeighborhood,\u201d where Teezo Touchdown was able to merge his corny, weird, and off-putting vocal delivery with good lyrics and a funky beat to make a good storytelling song, but the rest of this album was a total miss in every way it could\u2019ve been. Teezo Touchdown sounded like he was making emo pop punk rock for a Hannah Montana album on most of this project. His songs resembled the corniness and cringiness of The Click Five\u2019s \u201cPop Princess\u201d from HM1, the first Hannah Montana album, and his vocal delivery and lyrics varied from sounding childish to just being plain awful. At some parts, I found myself thinking, \u201cWhat fake-depressed, emo, 15-year-old boy wrote these stupid lyrics?,\u201d and at other times, I found myself thinking, \u201cDoes Teezo really expect people to take him seriously?.\u201d Emo pop punk rock in the style of the Disney Channel was definitely not it for Teezo Touchdown, but it\u2019s clear he never saw anything wrong with his errant lyrics, dumb vocals and delivery, and stupidly cringe flows. I\u2019m glad he got features from Janelle Mon\u00e1e & Foushe\u00e9 on this album because I got to hear a few tracks with vocals that were actually not horrible, but at the same time, Teezo Touchdown always brought them down with vocals that sounded like total and complete nonsense. He sings in the same style Mario Judah raps in: Like a villain in a Disney animated movie. It\u2019s operatic mixed with over-annunciation of words mixed with just plain awful singing. This album is a complete disappointment and I don\u2019t know what Drake was thinking when he co-signed this album; it\u2019s almost as much of an L as him co-signing Toronto rapper Smiley (Smiley even has a similar vocal style to Teezo Touchdown).", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 8, 2023Genres: Electronic (EDM), Art Pop, Psychedelia, Avant-Garde & Experimental, Indie (Singer-Songwriter)Tracks:Asking To Break \u2013 6.2Loading \u2013 7.4Tell Me \u2013 3.4Fall Back \u2013 7.4He\u2019s Been Wonderful \u2013 2.4Big Hammer (with The Ragga Twins) \u2013 0.3I Want You To Know \u2013 6.2Night Sky \u2013 6.5Fire The Editor \u2013 6.9If You Can Hear Me \u2013 7.3[Instrumental track \u201cPlaying Robots Into Heaven\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cConfusing aah\u201d album. If I had to describe this album in one word, it would be \u201cconfusing.\u201d James Blake is arguably one of the most experimental artists I listen to. Even on his last two albums, it was hard to put a genre or a label on his style of music, hence the numerous genre tags placed on this album and his other albums that have been rated on the review page. However, Assume Form, which is the best James Blake album despite being mid, had some structure to it and a few centralized concepts and musical styles. James Blake\u2019s lyrics have always been extremely abstract, conceptual, and hard to decipher, which is one of the reasons why he\u2019s considered art pop, but on Assume Form, his songs had structure (for the most part), his lyrics were a bit more grounded and less abstract, and the featured artists helped ground him and helped show off his production and vocal skills. Travis Scott, Moses Sumney, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Metro Boomin two times were the main things that helped James Blake stay the course on his best album Assume Form, but with Friends That Break Your Heart, James Blake\u2019s 2021 album, that formula crumbled and James Blake\u2019s abstract, conceptual, and experimental styles clashed horribly with the featured artists, featured producers, and pretty much everything on the album. He had a good collab with SZA on that album and his one song with Metro Boomin was the best on the album, but for the most part, it was a bad album with songs that just didn\u2019t make sense. This album is everything wrong with Friends That Break Your Heart amplified and exacerbated, along with a whole host of new mistakes that only James Blake could make in his rampant experimentation that knows no limits. The beats on this album just don\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. James Blake has a few good piano melodies and synth melodies on this album, and his voice is best when it\u2019s auto-tuned (those elements are what allowed him to get some songs in the 7-8 range), but just when something good happens, James Blake completely destroys it with some odd electronic beeping noise, an overly dramatic bass boost, a cringy vocal distortion, weird lyrics, or some terrible synth playing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard an album with more lack of direction, cohesion, and general sense that the songs are on the same album and from the same artist. James Blake makes a slew of utterly forgettable tracks on this album and fails to make any good songs as he fumbles around and essentially hits buttons on his keyboard in an attempt to be experimental. On some songs, it\u2019s as if James Blake is trying to make music like he did on his previous albums, but he\u2019s a shell of his former self, and on others, it sounds like he\u2019s trying to make an electronic version of Slowdive\u2019s 2023 album everything is alive. I don\u2019t know what James Blake was possibly thinking with this album, it\u2019s complete and utter unsorted garbage.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released July 29, 2016Genres: Hip-Hop/Rap, Trap, Pop Rap, Pop, Dancehall, ChristianTracks:I Got The Keys (feat.

Future & JAY-Z)\u201d: Starting an album with features from Future; an artist who was on an undeniable hot streak after having dropped DS2, What A Time To Be Alive, and March Madness in 2015 and Purple Reign and EVOL in 2016 before this album was released; and JAY-Z; an artist whose legacy has been cemented and can honestly coast off the buzz of his name for the rest of his career; sends a message, and DJ Khaled obviously intended to send one with this intro track. It\u2019s no secret that DJ Khaled doesn\u2019t often put any effort into his albums, as they\u2019re mostly just compilations of tracks by the hottest artists with beats by the hottest producers where DJ Khaled shouts out his catchphrases at the beginning of each song, but with this track, DJ Khaled isn\u2019t fooling around. This track actually seems like it\u2019s meant to announce DJ Khaled\u2019s arrival and a new album with the concept of the \u201ckeys to success.\u201d JAY-Z drops not one but two verses on this song, and Future handles the chorus. The first verse from JAY-Z is great and the second one is very good (the only thing that really keeps it from greatness is the part where HOV says \u201cY'all know it\u2019s one of one soon as you hear that uh-uh-uh (right?)\u201d), and while the chorus from Future is repetitive, aggressive, and sounds like he\u2019s saying \u201cI got no kids, kids, kids\u201d over and over again when he\u2019s really just saying the song title, he sounds so cool and charismatic doing it. It\u2019s hard to say this chorus is average when Future does such a great job with the vocal delivery. Good chorus from Future, and while the beat from Southside & DJ Khaled (yes, he finally helped produce a track) is very loud, abrasive, and has a melody that sounds like a fire alarm, it actually works well for this track. It\u2019s not perfect by any means, but the alarm sound of the beat gives the impression that everyone should stop what they\u2019re doing and listen to DJ Khaled. It\u2019s quite clever, but not the best beat. The outro from Future is also pretty repetitive and unnecessary. However, this song shows a much-needed spark of creativity from DJ Khaled and gives me the impression that I\u2019ll be grading more than just the performances of my favorite artists and the beats of my favorite producers on this album.\u201cFor Free (feat. Drake)\u201d: This song sounds like a bad track from Drake\u2019s album More Life (which came out in 2017, a year after this album) with a minute-long spoken outro from DJ Khaled that is completely unnecessary and brings the track\u2019s rating down a few points. I usually ignore whatever DJ Khaled does on his songs because it\u2019s usually very short and doesn\u2019t contribute hardly at all to the track, so it doesn\u2019t impact the rating, but this track is the first time I\u2019ve heard that his spoken content has been intrusive and impactful enough to make the track sound worse. This song starts out well, as the production from Nineteen85 (who was one of the main architects behind the dancehall sound of Drake\u2019s Views album) is a playful, upbeat, bouncy dancehall instrumental that sounds pretty good, and DJ Khaled\u2019s intro for Drake\u2019s first verse is pretty well-done. Drake\u2019s first verse is mid at best because it starts out well with a solid flow and good lyrics, but as soon as Drake says \u201cYour attitude on na-na, and your / P**** on agua, and your / Stomach on flat-flat, and your / A$$ on \u2018what\u2019s that?\u2019,\u201d it\u2019s all downhill from there. Those are some of the cringiest lines I\u2019ve ever heard from him. Drake proceeds to sound like a conceited douchebag on the chorus, as he asks himself if the girl he\u2019s with wonders if \u201cthe sex [is] so good, [she] shouldn\u2019t have to f\u2014 for free,\u201d and the second verse is mid at best as well, as Drake proceeds to break out more of the More Life flows that sound like combinations of dancehall and Afrobeat, and they don\u2019t sound good. There\u2019s another chorus, then DJ Khaled gives a garbage spoken outro that includes shouting out each member of OVO Sound and complaining about how \u201cthey ain\u2019t want [him] to have another anthem.\u201d Bad song.\u201cNas Album Done (feat. Nas)\u201d: I\u2019m not a huge fan of this song. With a Nas feature, production from Cool N Dre & DJ Khaled, a triumphant title that announces Nas' album is done (especially when the album referenced is Nas' 2017 album NASIR, one of his best albums), subject matter that goes along with the \u201ckeys to success\u201d \u201cMajor Key\u201d concept of this album, and a Fugees sample, this song should definitely be in the 9-10 range. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case, as this song is barely above mid. The sample of \u201cFu-Gee-La\u201d by Fugees is poorly used, as the high-pitched, squeaky, and abrasive nature of the vocal sample doesn\u2019t work well with DJ Khaled & Cool N Dre\u2019s attempt at a boom bap beat. The beat is mid, and Nas' lyrics aren\u2019t great either. The best lyrics he drops on the song involve Nas telling his supporters to \u201cgo support us like a local Black-owned grocery store,\u201d which he follows up by explaining the metaphor and finishing the verse off with the great line \u201cThe racial economic inequality, let\u2019s try to solve it.\u201d That\u2019s all in the first verse, but that verse is average at best because Nas starts it with the lines \u201cA divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meeter / Line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer,\u201d which is an overall cringy combination of words and sounds. The second verse is mid because Nas' lyrics get progressively worse and the only good lines come from him shouting out DJ Khaled\u2019s album. The chorus is good because Nas builds on the concepts DJ Khaled introduced on the opening track where he discusses the keys to success and says \u201cthat\u2019s a major key\u201d after dropping them. It\u2019s a good song, but barely, which is disappointing from a Nas collab.\u201cHoly Key (feat. Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar & Betty Wright)\u201d: Without Betty Wright on the chorus, bridge, and outro, this song is absolutely perfect. The triumphant, grandiose, horn-heavy production from DJ Khaled & Cool N Dre is great, and the verses from Big Sean & Kendrick Lamar are incredibly awesome. With its subject matter involving not only the keys to success and happiness but also spirituality, police brutality, racism, false idols, and staying focused through adversity, this song is the perfect bridge between the concepts of this album and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp A Butterfly. With the way both Kendrick Lamar & Big Sean are rapping on this song, this track would\u2019ve fit right in on To Pimp A Butterfly. Both artists have great flows, great lyrics, and they both shout out DJ Khaled and the album\u2019s main concept of the \u201ckeys to success\u201d in the form of the \u201choly key,\u201d which is the spiritual key to success. Betty Wright doesn\u2019t fit the song, though, as her gravelly, deep, and aggressive vocals on the chorus don\u2019t fit with the instrumental and clash with the great flows and vocals from Sean & Kendrick. Other than Betty Wright\u2019s feature, though, this song is perfect.\u201cJermaine\u2019s Interlude (feat. EARTHGANG & J. Cole)\u201d: Without EARTHGANG on the bridge, this song is near-perfect. It\u2019s tracks like this one that remind me why I like J. Cole as an artist. It\u2019s easy to become disillusioned with him because he\u2019s not an incredibly consistent artist, and I\u2019m gonna have to re-review his albums to get a more accurate read, but the verse he gives on this song is absolutely excellent. The chorus from J. Cole on this song is very good; I\u2019m taking off a point for the nihilistic subject matter of it, but J. Cole\u2019s smooth, laid-back singing manner is really good. The verse is amazing because J. Cole talks about the hip-hop industry, police brutality, racism, his childhood, and everything that has him in the headspace that he is in on this song. It\u2019s very introspective and a great verse from him. The production from. Hollywood JB is impeccable on this song as well; he mixes a trap drum pattern with an elegant, low-key, lo-fi, and laid-back melody, and it sounds amazing, especially considering J. Cole\u2019s singing and rapping on this song. Take off EARTHGANG and the song is almost perfect.\u201cDo You Mind (feat. August Alsina, Chris Brown, Future, Jeremih, Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross)\u201d: An awesome, anthemic R&B / pop rap song where DJ Khaled harnesses the power of collaboration and pulls together 6 artists \u2013 3 singers and 3 rappers \u2013 for an epic banger. The production on this song is outstanding; this song is another one produced by DJ Khaled in conjunction with other producers (L.V.M., Lee On The Beats, and DJ Nasty are the other producers on this track), and the minimalist beat built around a soothing grand piano melody is amazing for what the track is. The song starts with a laid-back, lo-fi, and low-key verse from Nicki Minaj that\u2019s a bit vulgar but still excellent, and then Chris Brown steals the show with an amazing chorus where he serenades a girl he\u2019s trying to get to know. It\u2019s charismatic, it\u2019s sensual, and his vocals are on point. Chris Brown usually always kills it on choruses, and this song just another example of that. After Chris Brown\u2019s chorus, August Alsina gives a second verse, and it\u2019s incredible. He continues the same sound Chris Brown started on the chorus and has great vocals, lyrics, and a great flow in the process. I only knew this dude for his infamous affair with Jada Pinkett Smith, but he\u2019s a great singer as well. Jeremih continues with the third verse after August Alsina, and he does an epic job as he normally does. DJ Khaled knew what he was doing when he put these three guys next to each other on this song; their combined effort (capped off by a second chorus from Breezy) is a sensual, flirtatious, and seductive part that completely takes the cake for the best part of the song. Future\u2019s fourth verse is good; he abandons his normal toxic and somewhat misogynist style in favor of a more loving and honest one on this song, and it\u2019s pretty good, but he falters vocally a few times. Rick Ross' fifth verse comes directly after and it\u2019s great, and after Chris Brown drops a third chorus, Nicki Minaj starts singing on the sixth verse on the song, which sounds great, as her verses normally do when she sings. This song is undoubtedly \u201canother one\u201d for DJ Khaled; six artists with different musical styles on one song definitely worked out in his favor.\u201cPick These Hoes Apart (feat. French Montana, Jeezy & Kodak Black)\u201d: The production from Ben Billions on this track is fire. The booming 808 bass is insane on this song, and juxtaposing it with a relatively sparse and lo-fi melody was a brilliant choice from him. The trap drum pattern is on point as well. Unfortunately, Ben Billions' great beat was wasted because nobody performed well on this song. To be fair, I had low expectations for this track and it was actually better than I expected it to be, but even still, Kodak Black & French Montana are mid at best and Jeezy is usually inconsistent. The first verse from Kodak Black is mid, but it\u2019s only mid because the second part is really good and some of the best bars he\u2019s ever dropped. This verse is obviously brought way down by the lines \u201cSoon I saw you, girl, my d*** was standin' hard / She so wet I make that p\u2014- fart,\u201d which are some of the worst and most cringy lines I\u2019ve ever heard, but once the beat gets going, Kodak Black switches up and finishes the verse strong, even making a reference to Michael Jackson. Jeezy\u2019s chorus was unbelievably lackluster, and his second verse was bad since it completely did not fit the beat. Somehow, French Montana\u2019s third verse was worse than Jeezy\u2019s second one, as he flowed in a weird falsetto voice and somehow fit the beat even less than Jeezy did, but his fourth verse (technically an outro verse) was not too bad, as he sang in auto-tune with ad-libs from Kodak Black and managed to partially redeem himself with an average at best performance. Bad song, but a few good elements.\u201cF*** Up The Club (feat. Future, Rick Ross, YG & Yo Gotti)\u201d: The fast-paced, energetic, \u201cget-up-and-go\u201d production from Cool N Dre & DJ Khaled was great, and Future displayed a similar energy on his repetitive yet hype chorus that was very good. I really wanted to like this song because it had the makings of a great track (when Future introduces a song with the line \u201cThis that 63 AMG Ghost music,\u201d it\u2019s gotta be a banger), but unfortunately, not everyone pulled their weight on the verses. Rick Ross' first verse was good, but once YG\u2019s second verse came around, the song went down in quality. YG\u2019s lyrics weren\u2019t good, his flow was choppy and inconsistent, and his grating, gravelly, grainy vocals were too harsh of a contrast to the clean production. The camera shutter click and the money counter beep sound effects on his verse were fire, but those were about the only things. Yo Gotti\u2019s verse wasn\u2019t much better, as he tried to match Future\u2019s hype from the chorus, and he did it in the opening lines, but his verse quickly degraded in quality and became mid and forgettable.\u201cWork For It (feat. Big Sean, Gucci Mane & 2 Chainz)\u201d: Big Sean is unfortunately lackluster on this song. He did an amazing job with his first feature on this album, but for this one, where he delivers the first and fourth verse on this track (as well as the chorus), he\u2019s average at best. The chorus is somewhat bland, as Big Sean doesn\u2019t really sound like he believes what he\u2019s saying on it, nor does he sound like he wants to be saying it, and the first verse has some bad lyrics and weird flows that don\u2019t really fit Big Sean\u2019s normal style and sound like he\u2019s trying to be a bargain brand version of Drake in some parts. On his fourth verse, he\u2019s lackluster again, but he has some better lines and his flows are a bit more consistent. The outro that follows his final chorus is also very odd and doesn\u2019t need to be on the song, as it\u2019s just him ad-libbing with his voice partially muted. The production from Metro Boomin on this song is very good, and it\u2019s especially good when it switches during Big Sean\u2019s second chorus at the 1:41 mark. At that point, the best part of the song occurs. From the start Big Sean\u2019s second chorus (it\u2019s actually made to sound pretty good with the beat) to the end of 2 Chainz\u2019s verse is the best part of the song. Gucci Mane & 2 Chainz absolutely go off on their verses, and maybe because the beat was switched to accommodate their appearances, but also because they simply outdo Big Sean on this song. They have two great verses and the Metro Boomin production is very good, but unfortunately, Big Sean doesn\u2019t bring his A-game on this song.\u201cDon\u2019t Ever Play Yourself (feat. Busta Rhymes, Fabolous, Fat Joe, Jadakiss & Kent Jones)\u201d: Without Busta Rhymes, this song would be perfect. The production from DJ Khaled & Cool N Dre (definitely a common theme on this album) is great on this track, as it gives the perfect forum for these five hip-hop artists to drop epic, amazing verses without any chorus and just go hard to make a get-up-and-go anthem, and four out of five of these rappers definitely did that. Since this track is named after one of DJ Khaled\u2019s favorite catchphrases, the theme of \u201cmajor key\u201d and \u201ckeys to success\u201d is brought back on this song. On the first verse, Jadakiss cleverly flips the concept into a drug reference and raps about cocaine, which is excellent. Fabolous does a great job on the second verse and Fat Joe does a great job on the third one, but the fourth one with Busta Rhymes is a different story. As I\u2019ve said many times, Busta Rhymes is incredibly inconsistent: it\u2019s impossible to tell how he\u2019s gonna be on a feature. This verse is good, but some of his lines are very bad and his flow is weird and often disregards the beat. It\u2019s still a good enough verse and gets the job done okay, but it\u2019s definitely not the best one on the song by any stretch. This song would\u2019ve gotten more points taken off for some of the cringe elements of this verse if Kent Jones hadn\u2019t finished the track with the best verse on the album. It sucks that Kent Jones became a one-hit wonder beholden to the artist graveyard that is DJ Khaled\u2019s We The Best Music because he had obvious talent and absolutely owned some hip-hop legends on this track with a great verse and some epic wordplay. If Busta Rhymes wasn\u2019t inconsistent and weird as he normally is, this song would\u2019ve been perfect.\u201cTourist (feat. Travis Scott & Lil Wayne)\u201d: This song was a track that was originally intended for Travis Scott\u2019s Days Before Rodeo album, but it was leaked online and never made the tracklist. In true DJ Khaled fashion, DJ Khaled took the track as it was, added a Lil Wayne feature, and looped part of Travis Scott\u2019s amazing psychedelic trap production (his production on this track was excellent and this song would\u2019ve sounded great on Days Before Rodeo). I\u2019m not mad at Khaled by any means, though, he did an amazing thing putting Lil Wayne & Travis Scott together on a song for the first time. Lil Wayne on a psychedelic trap beat alongside Travis Scott, even with the short verse he had on this song, is epic. The intro on this song is a bit dumb, as Travis Scott talks about a merry-go-round, uses the A$AP Rocky \u201cuh\u201d sound effect multiple times, and the beat is way too loud, but other than that part, both Travis Scott & Lil Wayne did excellent jobs with this track. I\u2019m almost glad this song didn\u2019t make it onto Days Before Rodeo because the Lil Wayne feature was very cool.\u201cForgive Me Father (feat. Meghan Trainor, Wale & Wiz Khalifa)\u201d: The chorus on this song from Meghan Trainor is actually surprisingly great. I don\u2019t like Meghan Trainor\u2019s music from what I\u2019ve heard of it, as her musical style is best described as 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s pop, bubblegum pop, pop country, and crappy songwriting mixed together, but the chorus on this track is surprisingly great. Unfortunately, Meghan Trainor had the best performance on this song. Wiz Khalifa\u2019s verse started out strong, but as soon as he started singing without auto-tune, he sounded absolutely absurd with his vocals, lyrics, and flow, and he was done dirty by bad post-production that didn\u2019t add in any vocal layering or auto-tune. He was hung out to dry, and his vocals absolutely sucked. Wale\u2019s verse was garbage because he didn\u2019t sound like he knew what he was talking about at all and was just saying words to fill space before the next Meghan Trainor chorus. I\u2019ve heard freestyles that sound more coherent than his verse on here. Ultimately, the song is mid and Meghan Trainor carried two hip-hop artists on a DJ Khaled album. That sentence was one I never thought I\u2019d have to say.It\u2019s no secret that DJ Khaled isn\u2019t really a musical artist. He\u2019s not a rapper, producer, songwriter, mixing engineer, or multi-instrumentalist of any kind (in fact, he has been openly mocked for his lack of knowledge about beat making and playing instruments). He is exactly what his title says he is: A DJ. He is a figure who brings artists and producers together on tracks and then puts those tracks on his albums, which act as playlists and snapshots of what\u2019s hot in the music industry (specifically in hip-hop & R&B) at the time of their releases. However, this album is different. This album isn\u2019t like Father Of Asahd, KHALED KHALED, or GOD DID, the three most recent DJ Khaled albums. On this album, DJ Khaled had a genuine concept in mind and played a role in the production of the songs on the album. While it ultimately fell through because of lack of proper execution and direction, DJ Khaled attempted to make Major Key a concept album about the \u201cmajor key\u201d and the \u201ckeys to success,\u201d not only in music and business, but in romantic relationships and one\u2019s relationship with God. Khaled didn\u2019t produce every song on the album, but he produced a good deal of them in conjunction with Cool N Dre, a respected producer duo who have been making hits in hip-hop & R&B since the early 2000\u2019s. The features and musical styles on this album are extremely diverse, more diverse than I would\u2019ve expected from a DJ Khaled album. On his last three albums, Khaled refused to step outside the realms of hip-hop, trap, reggae, and R&B, but on this album, DJ Khaled made pop songs (\u201cDo You Mind (feat. August Alsina, Chris Brown, Future, Jeremih, Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross),\u201d which also doubled as both a pop rap and R&B song, and \u201cForgive Me Father (feat. Meghan Trainor, Wale & Wiz Khalifa),\u201d which also had influences of gospel and pop rap), psychedelic songs (\u201cTourist (feat. Travis Scott & Lil Wayne),\u201d an obvious psychedelic trap song, and even \u201cJermaine\u2019s Interlude (feat. EARTHGANG & J. Cole)\u201d to a certain extent), dancehall tracks (\u201cProgress (feat. Mavado)\u201d & \u201cFor Free (feat. Drake),\u201d which were both bad, but they were still not what Khaled is used to having on his albums), and songs with Christian hip-hop influences (\u201cHoly Key (feat. Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar & Betty Wright),\u201d \u201cJermaine\u2019s Interlude (feat. EARTHGANG & J. Cole),\u201d \u201cWork For It (feat. Big Sean, Gucci Mane & 2 Chainz),\u201d and \u201cForgive Me Father (feat. Meghan Trainor, Wale & Wiz Khalifa),\u201d albeit GOD DID exists and the song of the same name has those themes incorporated on it). The features on this album would almost guarantee any rapper, R&B singer, or pop star an instant GOAT album: hip-hop titans JAY-Z, Drake, Nas, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne; trap heavyweights Future, Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz, and Travis Scott; hip-hop superstars Big Sean, Jeezy, Jadakiss, and Wiz Khalifa; R&B pioneers Chris Brown and Jeremih; and even pop star Meghan Trainor. In short, DJ Khaled knows how to stack an album with big names, and this album might be the best example of him using those big names to make good tracks that played up the concept he was going for. This album isn\u2019t flawless by any means; there are some definite bad songs on here, but DJ Khaled is more consistent, involved, and focused on this album than he\u2019s ever been, and that made for a pretty good album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 8, 2023Genres: Pop, Emo, Pop Rock, Punk, Soft RockTracks:all-american b**** \u2013 0.1bad idea right? \u2013 0.4vampire \u2013 1.6lacy \u2013 0.3ballad of a homeschooled girl \u2013 0.1making the bed \u2013 2logical \u2013 0.4get him back! \u2013 0.1love is embarrassing \u2013 0.1the grudge \u2013 0.6pretty isn\u2019t pretty \u2013 6teenage dream \u2013 2.2Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201call-american b****\u201d: Oh, boy, here we go again. Another Olivia Rodrigo album. At the very least, this song isn\u2019t leading a burgeoning diss track concept album about Joshua Bassett and Sabrina Carpenter, but then again, \u201cbrutal,\u201d the intro track to Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s diss track concept album debut project SOUR didn\u2019t do that either, so I guess there\u2019s still space for the one positive thing I can say about this song to be erased. There is so much wrong with this song that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. First of all, this song is more like a rejected demo track for The All-American Rejects than it is \u201call-american b\u2014-.\u201d I think Olivia Rodrigo intentionally tried to sound like the emo pop punk band The All-American Rejects on this song, but it sounded like a cheap, listless, formulaic, and lifeless imitation of the band who made the bangers \u201cMove Along\u201d and \u201cGives You Hell\u201d in the days when punk, emo, and pop rock were actually good. The acoustic guitar on the verses sounds like what would happen if The Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison was asked to play in blink-182. It\u2019s the most boring, repetitive, poorly played, and bland emo pop punk acoustic guitar melody I think I\u2019ve ever heard. What\u2019s worse is the grating, grainy, loud, and abrasive electric guitar on the choruses that\u2019s nearly at earrape volume in order to give the track a blink-182, The All-American Rejects, and Avril Lavigne rip-off punk rock sound. The lyrics on this song are abstract, conceptual, and built on bad metaphors that don\u2019t stick, and the excessive and unwarranted use of profanity combined with lines like \u201cAnd I\u2019m alright with the movies that make jokes \u2018bout senseless cruelty\u201d and cringy emo screaming that sounds like it could\u2019ve been on Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s Pink Tape metal songs with Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s abysmal D grade voice is just gratuitously bad. I can\u2019t believe Olivia Rodrigo actually managed to disappoint me with the low expectations I had. I\u2019m shocked at how bad this song is.\u201cbad idea right?\u201d: If the worst elements of The Velvet Underground, Talking Heads, blink-182, and Avril Lavigne were combined, all the creativity and uniqueness about their musical styles was sucked out, and what was left over was distilled and put into one song, this song would be the result. I\u2019m astonished at how Olivia Rodrigo is managing to make music this bad. I know SOUR got a terrible score from be since it was a diss track concept album and most of it was complete and utter garbage, but at least a few of the tracks had some merit. This album is sounding like Trippie Redd & Travis Barker\u2019s Neon Shark vs. Pegasus emo pop punk experiment album so far, which is not good in the least bit. The flows on the verses on this song sound like Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s all-time worst song \u201cskinny dipping\u201d mixed with Lou Reed\u2019s talking flow that he used on the album The Velvet Underground & Nico, the vocals are D of D- grade at best (Olivia Rodrigo sounds like the bargain-brand version of Avril Lavigne on this song), the lyrics and vocal distortions make the song nearly unlistenable, and while some of the guitar riffs sound okay, they\u2019re completely stolen from blink-182. This song is complete and irredeemable garbage.\u201cvampire\u201d: This album\u2019s equivalent of \u201cdrivers license\u201d which borrows some of the same flows and vocal cadences from Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s debut breakout Sabrina Carpenter diss track single. This song isn\u2019t as terrible as some of the previous songs, but it\u2019s a sad, slow, depressing piano ballad where Olivia Rodrigo warbles in a talking flow and terrible vocals that make her sound like Lou Reed on the verses. On the overly climactic and melodramatic choruses, Olivia Rodrigo makes an emotional plea that\u2019s crowded by her ridiculous and melodramatic crappy vocals and the infusion of EDM / house drums to go alongside the pop punk guitars that suddenly appear and then disappear. I didn\u2019t think the production on this album could get any worse, as it was obviously already ripping off Trippie Redd & Travis Barker\u2019s Neon Shark vs. Pegasus on the first few songs (arguably one of the worst albums of all time), but now Olivia decides to rip off Drake\u2019s worst album Honestly, Nevermind? It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s compiling a tapestry of bad music and piecing it together to form her own abysmal style. She\u2019s got her own crappy vocals, which she\u2019s been combining with Lou Reed\u2019s talking, harsh, halting flows, Avril Lavigne\u2019s vocal cadences if they were more grating than they already are, Trippie Redd & Travis Barker\u2019s experimental emo pop punk rap production, and now Drake\u2019s ridiculously bad EDM / house production. Overall, this song is absolutely awful and there\u2019s not much to it other than that, as Olivia Rodrigo attempts to make everyone feel sorry for her while excessively emphasizing the curse words and making Lou Reed\u2019s The Velvet Underground & Nico flows even worse than they already were.\u201clacy\u201d: Olivia Rodrigo is now going after synthpop with this song! At least, on the instrumental break, she brings in the synth solo, and it sounds like garbage. There\u2019s no nuance or creativity in it whatsoever, and it sounds just as lifeless as any of the songs on Katy Perry\u2019s terrible Witness album. As for the rest of the song, it has an acoustic guitar instrumental that Olivia Rodrigo sings in a whispered, hushed, halting, and harsh flow that sounds like Lou Reed if he had Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s D- grade (she\u2019s now dropped from D to D-) vocals and was trying to do ASMR. As for the lyrical content and subject matter, I\u2019m gonna drop a quote from the Barbie movie to explain it: \u201cMen hate women, women hate women,\u201d specifically emphasizing the latter part. Now, I\u2019m immensely proud to say I\u2019m a guy who doesn\u2019t fall into the category of \u201cwomen hater,\u201d but I\u2019m saddened that Olivia Rodrigo is contributing to the \u201cwomen hating women\u201d category with this track that\u2019s basically a worse version of Tate McRae\u2019s already bad song \u201cshe\u2019s all i wanna be.\u201d Olivia, with a bunch of emo pop lyrics and crappy metaphors, basically says how much she envies a girl that has everything she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s just complete and total garbage. This album continues to find new ways to be bad.\u201cballad of a homeschooled girl\u201d: I don\u2019t believe it. Olivia Rodrigo actually managed to sound exactly like Trippie Redd with her vocals on this song. In addition to the instrumental completely ripping off Green Day\u2019s \u201cKnow Your Enemy,\u201d Olivia Rodrigo completely copies Trippie Redd\u2019s emo, screamo, pop punk rap style on this track with her vocals, and it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s taking major influence from Trippie Redd & Travis Barker\u2019s Neon Shark vs. Pegasus with this album\u2019s songs. An instant skip.\u201cmaking the bed\u201d: A depressing, nihilistic track where Olivia Rodrigo advocates underage drinking (not a terrible thing, but considering how many of her fans are pre-teen and teenage girls, it\u2019s not exactly the best thing, especially since Olivia Rodrigo herself was underage at the time of this album\u2019s release) on an instrumental that has a good bass guitar but nothing else that has remotely any flavor or life to it. It may be the best song on the album so far, but it\u2019s utterly God-awful.\u201cget him back!\u201d: In the latest of her failed experiments and terrible attempts at good pop music, Olivia Rodrigo tries to turn Hannah Montana\u2019s \u201cQue Sera\u201d into an emo pop punk song with depressing lyrics and cringy vocal delivery while completely stealing the flow from \u201cQue Sera.\u201d The chorus is another shameless Avril Lavigne rip-off, and the bass guitar is mixed as badly on this song as Sterling Morrison\u2019s bass guitar was mixed on The Velvet Underground & Nico; it sounds like badly mixed Pop Smoke music where the 808 slides are at earrape volume. Nothing about this song is remotely good, especially the bridge from Olivia and the raucous and obnoxious guitar solo that follows it.\u201clove is embarrassing\u201d: If Taylor Swift had no talent, dressed up like Taylor Momsen, and made a song with Teezo Touchdown on a Neon Shark vs. Pegasus type beat, this track would be the result. It\u2019s actually horrendously awful, as Olivia Rodrigo attempts to mimic Teezo Touchdown\u2019s vocal delivery from his unorthodox verse on Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cMODERN JAM (feat. Teezo Touchdown),\u201d and completely botches it in the process, while simultaneously sounding like a goth, emo version of the bargain-brand Taylor Swift. In addition, Olivia paints herself as a \u201chapless romantic\u201d on this song, and what is up with the guys she\u2019s dating? Who actually cries to their new girlfriend about their ex-girlfriend\u2019s new boyfriend? Seriously, the amount of bottom-feeders Olivia Rodrigo has been dating is honestly astounding. Such a bad song.\u201cpretty isn\u2019t pretty\u201d: Probably the most genuine and authentic song Olivia Rodrigo has ever made. It breaks my heart to know that she struggles with a negative self-image and has fought eating disorders, and this song is quite sad for those reasons. The subject matter definitely made me tear up and get emotional, and this song is the first one on the album that I believe Olivia is trying to show her true self. Her vocals are still not good and her lyrics could use some tuning up, but the instrumental on this track is very inoffensive and not too bad, so the song definitely has potential, and considering how Olivia poured her heart out into this track, she definitely earned points from me for that. Although the bottom line is Olivia Rodrigo isn\u2019t a good artist and one song that\u2019s not horrendously bad won\u2019t change that, this song is bad, not garbage, and that\u2019s a spiritual victory for Olivia.\u201cteenage dream\u201d: A nihilistic, iconoclastic, and defeatist outlook on life on this track that shares a name with Katy Perry\u2019s great song \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d and shares everything else with Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever,\u201d although that track was way better than this one. This song is yet another example of Olivia Rodrigo ripping off a superior pop star and completely degrading their song and musical style in the process. This song features an earrape volume guitar part that comes out of utterly nowhere in this acoustic grand piano melody \u201csad girl emo pop\u201d song, and it sounds as if the post-production attempted to make it sound as loud as they possibly could without making it extremely grainy. It\u2019s dumb, this song\u2019s lyrics are dumb and nihilistic, and the vocals from Olivia Rodrigo are not good. That\u2019s been a well-established fact on this album, but I\u2019m reiterating it a final time: Olivia Rodrigo sucks as a vocalist. A crappy end to probably the worst album of 2023.Goodness gracious, where to begin? Well, for starters, this album will be competing with Lil Pump\u2019s horrendous album Lil Pump 2 and Coi Leray\u2019s fall-off album COI for the title of WAOTY (worst album of the year) for 2023. It\u2019s no secret that I hate Olivia Rodrigo and that I strongly disliked her debut album SOUR, which I mainly criticize for being a diss track concept album where all of the songs lambast Joshua Bassett and Sabrina Carpenter, but also for its lack of creativity, lack of good production, and bad vocals, which are many of the same criticisms I have with this album. This album has many of the crappy qualities that SOUR had, but it somehow manages to suck even more. Olivia Rodrigo sticks within the confines of emo pop, punk, emo pop rock, and soft rock on this album, and she manages to be horrible in new ways in each genre. Some of the artists she blatantly rips off and sounds like the most watered-down, bargain-brand, and contrived version of are The All-American Rejects (specifically with the intro track \u201call-american b****\u201d), Avril Lavigne (who Olivia Rodrigo rips off on pretty much every chorus she does on the entire album, botching Avril Lavigne\u2019s vocal cadence every time), Lou Reed & The Velvet Underground (mostly with flows and vocal delivery, as Olivia Rodrigo pretty much takes Lou Reed\u2019s talking, halting, and harsh flow and makes it her own, somehow making it worse than Lou Reed makes it), blink-182 (mostly with production, as most of this album\u2019s instrumentals sound like blink-182 rejects or songs that Travis Barker produced for his Trippie Redd collab album Neon Shark vs. Pegasus), Trippie Redd (whose vocals she rips off on \u201cballad of a homeschooled girl\u201d), Hannah Montana (she poorly flips \u201cQue Sera\u201d from Hannah\u2019s fourth album on \u201cget him back!\u201d), and Billie Eilish (whose song \u201cHappier Than Ever\u201d she rips off on this album\u2019s outro \u201cteenage dream\u201d). It\u2019s as if Olivia Rodrigo had nothing original to contribute with this album, so she chose to take other musicians' musical styles, combine them, and turn them into complete cringe. The one song I\u2019ll say has merit on this album is \u201cpretty isn\u2019t pretty,\u201d where Olivia gets real about her struggles with her body image and pours her heart out in a pretty emotional song. Unfortunately, the harsh reality is that she\u2019s not a good singer, nor is she a good songwriter, which makes the song bad. Overall, this album sounds like what would happen if Travis Barker produced a collab album between Trippie Redd, Avril Lavigne, and Lou Reed that resembled Neon Shark vs. Pegasus in every way it possibly could, only that it tried to be more experimental and worse when it could. Such a bad album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released June 9, 2017Genres: Pop, Synthpop, Pop RapTracks:Witness \u2013 4.3Hey Hey Hey \u2013 0.1Roulette \u2013 6Swish Swish (feat.

The first type of boring is that the song just doesn\u2019t bring anything to the table; it\u2019s boring because the lyrics, vocals, flows, or production (or all of the above in some cases) are mid and uninspired, therefore warranting a mid score. The first type of boring is not bad, but not good either: just mid and unenjoyable. The second type of boring is much worse. It\u2019s not as common, but it\u2019s where the song is so bland, boring, and listless on all levels (lyrics, vocals, flows, and production) that the song is genuinely terrible. The second type of boring is genuinely painful to listen to because of how little effort was put into all of its elements. Unfortunately, Katy Perry has started this album with a song that\u2019s the second type of boring. The production from Max Martin is shockingly bad, as this beat sounds like what would happen if someone stripped all of the creative elements away from synthpop and made a beat with what was left over, and even the most basic elements of synthpop are poorly executed on this song. The lyrics from Katy Perry are painstakingly cookie-cutter and surface-level, and though she\u2019s trying to be \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201cmeaningful\u201d and trying to make a statement about love in modern society with these lyrics, she fails to make any coherent claims. The vocals sound half-baked, phoned-in, and lifeless, and the flows are sometimes on the beat, but most of the time off. Katy Perry sounds like she didn\u2019t care what happened at all on this song, and as if she just wanted to get it over with. I like some of Katy Perry\u2019s music, as her commercial hits in the late 2000\u2019s and the early 2010\u2019s were pop music staples that I really enjoyed listening to when I was younger (and quite frankly still enjoy listening to today), but this song is just completely awful. If synthpop was stripped of everything that made it good, this song would be the result. Katy Perry\u2019s shaping up for an Alyssa Milano level album with this intro track.\u201cHey Hey Hey\u201d: Wow, this song is horrendously awful. The production from Max Martin is shockingly bad again; I refuse to believe that he\u2019s lost his touch as a pop superproducer, so I have to assume that he was phoning it in and giving Katy Perry the worst beats he\u2019s ever made for this album because there\u2019s no way he\u2019s actually making synthpop instrumentals that are this bad on purpose. This beat is another one that sounds like the most vapid and creatively empty version of synthpop ever, as if everything that\u2019s cool and interesting about the genre was sucked out and the leftover elements were put on this instrumental. Katy Perry\u2019s lyrics on this song are some of the most tone-deaf, cookie-cutter, trite, contrived, pseudo-feminist garbage I\u2019ve ever heard. Katy Perry opens the song with the line \u201cA big beautiful brain with a pretty face,\u201d and closes the first verse with \u201cMarilyn Monroe in a monster truck,\u201d singing as if it\u2019s uncommon for a pretty girl to be intelligent or multi-faceted. Rather than being a female empowerment anthem, this song, if anything, enforces misogynist stereotypes and ancient gender roles. When Katy Perry describes herself as \u201cfeminine and soft, but I\u2019m still the boss,\u201d she acts as if she\u2019s out of the ordinary and the exception to the rule, which is tone-deaf and dumb. The vocals are bland, boring, stupid, and lifeless, and the chorus on this song is one of the worst ones I\u2019ve ever heard. The vocals are cringy and condescending, and Katy Perry smugly acts like she\u2019s a feminist champion on the chorus, but she\u2019s the furthest thing from it. Other lyrics like \u201cLOL at all your limits\u201d and \u201cGot my own cha-ching in my chubby little wallet\u201d aren\u2019t necessarily tone-deaf, but they\u2019re just cringy and weird. This song absolutely sucks in every way it can.\u201cRoulette\u201d: Another stale and banal synth instrumental from Max Martin. On this song, the synths are more prominent, but they sound lifeless, flavorless, and just plain boring. The chord progression is weird and poorly executed, and the synth melody on the verses is so subdued that it\u2019s barely noticeable and doesn\u2019t contribute hardly anything to the song. The verses from Katy Perry have mid at best vocals and lyrics, and while the chorus is average at best and shows some signs of life from Katy Perry lyrically and vocally, it still sounds incredibly vanilla and barely gets above mid. This song also shows that Katy Perry doesn\u2019t understand the difference between the casino game roulette and Russian roulette, where a 6-shot revolver is loaded with one bullet and people take turns shooting the gun, as the third verse has lines that insinuate she\u2019s talking about the latter instead of the former, but she doesn\u2019t acknowledge that. This song is just another example of flavorless, bland, lifeless, bad synthpop from Katy Perry and famed pop superproducer Max Martin.\u201cSwish Swish (feat. Nicki Minaj)\u201d: This song\u2019s cringe factor is established extremely early. The first thing on this song is a ridiculous, stupid, and out-of-place pitched-down vocal sample that says in a mockingly intimidating voice \u201cThey know what is what, but they don\u2019t know what is what, they just strut, what the f***?,\u201d which is followed by a dumb grand piano melody and Katy Perry opening her first verse with the lines \u201cA tiger don\u2019t lose no sleep / Over opinions from a shellfish or a sheep.\u201d What is she even on about? I guess she\u2019s the tiger, which references her commercial hit single \u201cRoar,\u201d but a shellfish or a sheep? What do those things have in common? The song\u2019s instrumental then turns into the most basic, formulaic, and generic EDM / house beat of all time; it sounds like a reject from Drake\u2019s Honestly, Nevermind album. On the verses, Katy Perry sneak-disses Taylor Swift with some of the worst diss track lyrics I\u2019ve ever heard, and some of the worst lyrics period that I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201c\u2018Cause you\u2019re a joker, and I\u2019m a court side-killer queen,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re 'bout as cute as an old coupon expired\u201d are some of the lowlight quotables of this song. In addition, the chorus is absolutely ridiculous and stupid, as Katy Perry adopts the same flow as the formulaic and generic EDM / house instrumental has, which is accompanied by a garbage sample of \u201cIt Takes Two\u201d by Rob Base & DJ EZ-Rock that\u2019s pitched up and sounds horrifically bad. The transition from the chorus to Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse is pretty good, and Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse starts out strong (the reference to Migos, who are also featured on this album, was pretty well-done), but after about eight lines, the verse devolves into Nicki Minaj singing in an operatic tone, then the beat being switched on and off as she finishes her verse. The rest of the song after that is just Katy Perry doing more garbage that\u2019s unlistenable. A terrible and trash song and a sorry attempt at a Taylor Swift diss track.\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u201d: The production from Hayden James and the chorus from Katy Perry are both mildly average on this song, but everything else is garbage. The lyrics are getting progressively worse as the album goes on; I thought the first four tracks had bad lyrics (and they do), but the lyrics on the verses on this song are just completely terrible. The first verse is awful, and the second verse opens with some of the worst lyrics I\u2019ve ever heard: \u201cYour words are like Chinese water torture / And there\u2019s no finish line, always one more corner / Yeah, they slither like a centipede.\u201d These lines don\u2019t make remotely any sense, and any attempt by Katy Perry to be abstract and metaphorical with these lines completely fails because I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. The chorus starts off with some pretty trash lyrics: \u201cEvery day\u2019s the same / Definition of insane,\u201d but when Katy Perry sings \u201cI think we\u2019re running on a loop\u201d over the synth bass melody from Hayden James, it\u2019s one of the best moments on the album for both production and vocals by Katy Perry. That part, along with the minimalist synthpop instrumental from Hayden James that sounds like the production on Zara Larsson\u2019s \u201cPoster Girl\u201d mixed with Depeche Mode, are the only redeeming things about this song. Other than that, it\u2019s another terrible track from Katy Perry.\u201cPower\u201d: Well, I guess because Katy Perry called this song \u201cPower,\u201d she thought she\u2019d try to follow in the footsteps of Kanye West\u2019s experimental industrial sound he cultivated on his 2013 album Yeezus with the production and vocals on this song. However, in Katy Perry\u2019s attempt to be experimental and add an industrial sound into her brand of pop music, she completely failed and has on this song one of the worst instrumentals I\u2019ve ever heard on a pop song or on any song. The production on this song is disjointed, misguided, and directionless, as random industrial drums come out of nowhere constantly throughout the song, and random saxophone flourishes come out of nowhere quite frequently as well. The backing vocals are mixed terribly and contribute nothing to the song, and Katy Perry\u2019s lyrics and vocals continue to get progressively worse as the album goes on. The lyrics are just as directionless and disjointed as the production, and the flows on the verses and on the chorus are equally disjointed as well. This song is an example of Katy Perry throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks, but trying to be Kanye West in the process and completely missing the mark.\u201cMind Maze\u201d: Another bland, boring, uninspired, and uninventive synthpop instrumental that takes out all of the creative and interesting elements of synthpop and degrades it into this garbage beat. Excessive use of auto-tune on Katy Perry\u2019s vocals that makes her vocals sound even more hollow and terrible than they usually are; bad lyrics; bad flows; and an overall lackluster, half-baked, and trash performance from Katy Perry. That\u2019s how this song can be characterized in a nutshell. It\u2019s another completely awful song that shows just how little Katy Perry has to offer creatively on this album.\u201cChained To The Rhythm (feat. Skip Marley)\u201d: The lack of self awareness and tone-deafness Katy Perry displays on this song is absolutely astonishing. This song is about pop music and how people enjoy listening to pop music and going out and partying to escape the real issues of their lives and that the world is facing today. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s a bad thing to want an escape from reality, but apparently, Katy thinks it is, and she gives a clunky, overly metaphorical, and woefully lacking explanation as to why. \u201cTurn it up, it\u2019s your favorite song / Dance, dance, dance to the distortion / Turn it up, keep it on repeat / Stumbling around like a wasted zombie,\u201d Katy sings on the chorus, talking in circles about how upbeat and catchy pop music is a bad thing because \u201cthere are real issues that are being ignored,\u201d apparently, but Katy doesn\u2019t even attempt to address any of them with this song. \u201cAre we tone-deaf?\u201d Katy asks at the beginning of the second verse, a question she would be better off asking herself with how empty and vapid this supposedly \u201cconscious pop\u201d song is. In reality, Katy Perry has contributed a great deal to catchy and upbeat pop music throughout her career, so her rebuke of this style is essentially Jack Harlow on \u201cCommon Ground\u201d trying to rebuke white people\u2019s enjoyment of hip-hop music. The production from Max Martin is horrendously bland and boring; it\u2019s as if he was making a beat for an album called \u201cambient music to play on the Walmart speakers,\u201d and the feature verse from Skip Marley was dumb and completely unnecessary. His flow started out strong, but he quickly faded and was overtaken by Katy Perry before he could make any meaningful contribution to the song. Absolute trash.\u201cTsunami\u201d: By far the best song on the album so far. On a great beat produced by Mike WiLL Made-It that is a lo-fi, laid-back, and low-key minimalist trap instrumental that sounds like it could\u2019ve been used by Drake or Miley Cyrus on one of their slower and more introspective songs, Katy Perry delivers some of her best vocals thus far on the album and creates an extended metaphor that likens falling in love to being swept away by a wave that\u2019s her most cohesive and coherent concept so far on the album. Now, this song isn\u2019t perfect, as Mike WiLL Made-It\u2019s production outshines Katy Perry by far on this song and Katy Perry still doesn\u2019t perform as well as I know she can, but this song is an obvious step in the right direction.\u201cBon App\u00e9tit (feat. Migos)\u201d: As I suspected they would, Migos completely stole the show on this song. Migos is obviously a cheat-code feature at any time, but this album was released in the summer of 2017, after Migos' magnum opus best album Culture, which is one of the greatest albums of all time. Those guys were at the top of their game in 2017 and had the world in the palm of their hand, so it\u2019s safe to say that this song no longer belonged to Katy Perry after she decided to go with the Migos feature. The group verse from Migos is the only thing that boosted this song into the 7-8 range. They had a group verse, which I\u2019m not typically a fan of, but Quavo, Takeoff, and Offset all had a few bars on it, and though they didn\u2019t necessarily deliver their greatest bars, they were good, and that\u2019s all they needed to be to rescue this song from being bad. Quavo sounded like he could\u2019ve sang the phone book on this song; the auto-tune use was impeccable and his vocals absolutely blew Katy\u2019s out of the water, and his hype ad-libs to prepare for the Migos verse were perhaps the coolest part of the song save the actual verse. The first two verses from Katy Perry, her pre-choruses, and choruses were all mid at best, and the production wasn\u2019t anything special either; just another mid EDM / house beat that sounded like it belonged on Drake\u2019s Honestly, Nevermind. The thing that frustrates me is that Katy Perry had to be the female popstar that Migos collaborated with. If it had been anyone else: Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, or Rihanna, this song would not only have been a commercial hit, but a landmark banger with legacy. Since Katy Perry is so painstakingly mid throughout this album, no songs from it have that kind of quality. For one of Migos' only pop collaborations, I hate that it had to be Katy Perry.\u201cSave As Draft\u201d: It\u2019s almost like Katy Perry is going out of her way to make bad music at this point. This song is a total \u201cindie emo sad girl pop\u201d song complete with a Ted Ed piano melody for the instrumental, vocal delivery that sounds almost exactly like Olivia Rodrigo (although Olivia Rodrigo didn\u2019t get her start until 2021 with \u201cdrivers license,\u201d this song still sounds like it\u2019s Katy Perry ripping her off; that\u2019s how disingenuous it sounds), and lyrics like \u201cI don\u2019t f*** with change but I\u2019ve been flipping coins lately\u201d (a half-baked and lame attempt at wordplay) and \u201cI struggle, I juggle\u201d to start off the chorus. This song is absolutely garbage and adds to the laundry list of abhorrently awful songs on this album.\u201cDance With The Devil\u201d: Katy Perry actually recycled lyrics from \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u201d on this song (the line about the definition of insanity was used as the chorus on that song) and expected everyone not to notice. She also chose a drill beat to sing on with this track. It did not work and crashed and burned in every way it possibly could have. An instant skip.\u201cAct My Age\u201d: What did the great movie starring Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo 13 Going On 30 ever do to Katy Perry to deserve an inclusion on this God-awful song? She opened the song with a reversal of the movie\u2019s title, then goes on to talk about how \u201cthey\u201d say she \u201cmight lose [her] Midas touch\u201d and she\u2019ll \u201cbecome irrelevant,\u201d but then responds with \u201cbut who the f*** are they anyway?.\u201d Well, Katy, apparently \u201cthey\u201d have gotten you fired up enough to make this track describing a rebellion against \u201cthem\u201d on a tongue-and-cheek, whimsical song that\u2019s devoid of anything remotely creative or good. This song is so bad that its concept gets completely lost in translation and becomes muddied and incoherent because of how terrible Katy Perry is as a songwriter. This song is an absolute joke of a track that proves Katy is listening to her haters regardless of if she wants to admit it or not.This album was the beginning of the end of Katy Perry\u2019s career. In the late 2000\u2019s to early 2010\u2019s, Katy Perry was one of the biggest pop stars of all time. Her fame rivaled the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Adele, Britney Spears, and Lady Gaga, and she was bigger than Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande were at that time, which seems unheard of considering how Miley & Ari are two staple names in pop music today. There was a time when Katy Perry was synonymous with pop music; she broke records like they were nothing and made good music in the process. However, this album marked a complete shift for Katy Perry. Leading up to this album\u2019s release, Katy Perry had been involved in several public incidents. She started a high-profile beef with Taylor Swift, one of the biggest pop stars in the world, and went on astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson\u2019s podcast and asked him \u201cIs math related to science?,\u201d which caused her to become the butt of many jokes, including one where immensely popular YouTuber PewDiePie called her out and called the comment a blatant attempt to \u201cpromote her s***ty f\u2014ing album.\u201d I don\u2019t know if he ever listened to this album, but his initial assessment was extremely correct. This album is complete and utter garbage. With an image change from long black hair to short blonde hair, a shift to hip-hop and trap styles alongside her regular pop style, features from high-profile hip-hop artists Nicki Minaj & Migos, and recruitment of hip-hop producer Mike WiLL Made-It (he produced \u201cTsunami,\u201d the one good song on this album); Katy Perry attempted to replicate Miley Cyrus' 2013 Bangerz era. It was a blatant rip-off of something that had already been done by Miley Cyrus, and while Miley didn\u2019t execute her genre and image shift well, Katy somehow managed to do it worse. While promoting this album, Katy Perry referred to the subject matter on it as \u201cpurposeful pop.\u201d That is, perhaps, the biggest lie that has ever been told in the history of music. This album\u2019s songs could not be more devoid of subject matter or lyrically terrible. The lyrics on this album make ChatGPT with the prompt \u201cwrite a pop song\u201d sound like Justin Timberlake, Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift, or Ariana Grande. Seriously, Katy Perry can\u2019t write a good song to save her life on this album. The production from Max Martin is shockingly bad, as he creates synthpop instrumentals completely lacking anything that makes synthpop good, and even when Max Martin isn\u2019t producing, that style persists, unless it\u2019s bland regular pop, crappy EDM / house, bad trap, or the one great beat on the album: Mike WiLL Made-It\u2019s beat on \u201cTsunami.\u201d Perhaps the biggest testament to this album\u2019s failure in every way is the Migos collaboration. Quavo, Takeoff, and Offset show up on that track. They did a very good job on the group verse they had, and Quavo\u2019s vocals sounded better than Katy Perry\u2019s. However, Katy Perry still managed to make the song mid with her lackluster performance. If you get a Migos feature, especially a Migos feature in 2017 when they released their magnum opus Culture, and the song ends up being mid, that\u2019s a sign you\u2019re doing something horribly wrong. Katy Perry sealed the deal on her career and started her fall-off with this album, and if a fall-off from one album were possible, this album would\u2019ve undoubtedly done it.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released March 12, 1967Genres: Art Rock, Punk, Classic Rock, Folk, Psychedelia, Country, Avant-Garde & Experimental, Indie (Singer-Songwriter)Tracks:Sunday Morning \u2013 10I\u2019m Waiting For The Man \u2013 7.4Femme Fatale \u2013 5.4Venus In Furs \u2013 1Run Run Run \u2013 2All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties \u2013 4.8Heroin \u2013 4.5There She Goes Again \u2013 7.4I\u2019ll Be Your Mirror \u2013 7.2The Black Angel\u2019s Death Song \u2013 0.1European Son \u2013 0.1Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cSunday Morning\u201d: I had no idea what to expect from this intro track. I was told that this album was one of the most influential albums in the history of rock music, and that it fused sounds of punk, indie rock, indie pop, psychedelia, 70\u2019s art rock, and even some 80\u2019s rock while coming before all of it. I was told it was a visionary album that was ridiculously ahead of its time. I had never heard anything by Lou Reed, Nico, or The Velvet Underground with either of them as vocalists (the only song I\u2019d ever heard by The Velvet Underground was \u201cAfter Hours,\u201d which was entirely awful and one of the worst songs I\u2019d ever heard since it predated \u201csad girl / sad boy\u201d music, indie pop rock, and indie folk but somehow encapsulated all of them), so I was going into this song completely blind. I was extremely pleasantly surprised by how great this song was. This track is a laid-back, low-key, lo-fi, and psychedelic track where lead singer Lou Reed sings in a mellow and relaxed voice. The bell sound effects on the melody start out a bit grating, but when they\u2019re mixed with the laid-back drumming from Maureen Tucker and great bass guitar melody from John Cale, they blend brilliantly and sound really good. The ending electric guitar melody from Sterling Morrison is also very well done and serves as a great ending for this track. Lou Reed\u2019s voice on this song sounds like a mixture of Tom Petty and Donna from That 70\u2019s Show, which is definitely an odd combination, but it works really well on this song. The song\u2019s subject matter about the morning after pulling an all-nighter of partying is perfectly encapsulated by the easygoing, psychedelic sound of the track. I\u2019m very impressed and quite pleasantly surprised by this intro track.\u201cI\u2019m Waiting For The Man\u201d: This song is a complete tonal shift from the mellow, psychedelic sound introduced on the intro track. On this song, Lou Reed\u2019s vocals sound more like I imagined they would (like a frontman for a late 60\u2019s rock band), but that\u2019s not to say that his voice isn\u2019t unique. On this track, Lou Reed\u2019s flow on all of the verses is the same: he\u2019s talking rather than singing, and talking in an impatient tone. His flows on these verses sound like he had to go to the bathroom, but the other band members wouldn\u2019t let him leave the booth before he recorded the verses. The harsh, halting, and spoken flow on the verses is intentional, though, as this song is about Lou Reed waiting for a drug dealer to arrive at a location so he can buy heroin from him, and the song\u2019s verses are his thought process and the people who pass him on the street asking him questions about what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s an interesting concept, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s echoed in the instrumental as well. The electric guitar melody from Sterling Morrison on this song is impatient and repetitive, but progressively gets more grainy as the song goes on. The distortion and amplifier feedback on the electric guitar reaches near earrape levels at one point on the track during one of the instrumental breaks, and it\u2019s too much. This song is incredibly off-putting, and though I can respect Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison, and The Velvet Underground for their experimental guitar-playing technique and adherence to a central concept, the song sounds very odd because of it. This track is mid overall because of the weird techniques, extreme distortion, the repetitive guitar playing, and Lou Reed\u2019s flow that sounds like he needs to use the bathroom.\u201cFemme Fatale\u201d: First song on the album with Nico, the German singer and model who just happens to also be a neo-Nazi who was a raving racist (however, I\u2019m gonna separate the art from the artist here), on lead vocals, and it\u2019s undoubtedly a disappointment. The acoustic guitar from Sterling Morrison on this song has the same repetitive melody as the last track, but it\u2019s slower and has a different chord structure. The mixing on this song is just absolutely atrocious. There are random points in the track where the bass guitar on the bassline from John Cale is boosted to earrape volume, and there are other points where Nico\u2019s vocals are boosted to earrape volume alongside the bass guitar. The awful mixing on this song makes the track sound like I\u2019m listening to a badly mixed Pop Smoke or Fivio Foreign song (anything in the drill genre) where the 808 slides are louder than everything else for some weird reason. The vocals from Nico on this song are just not good at all. Her voice, complete with a German accent, sounds like what James Blake would sound like if he was a female singer with bad vocal mixing. The lyrics on this song, as well as the backing vocals from Lou Reed & Sterling Morrison on the chorus singing \u201cshe\u2019s a femme fatale\u201d in the right channel only, are bad, as Nico is talking about a prostitute and basically explaining her life story in the most convoluted and conceptual way possible. I know this album was released in 1967, but The Doors\u2019 debut album, which was released only a few months before this one, has mixing that is so much better than anything on this track, so it\u2019s just unacceptable. Bad song.\u201cVenus In Furs\u201d: This album started out with a 10, but it has quickly gone downhill and hit the lowest point so far. This song is very heavy and sounds like it could be a prototype for many songs in the punk and traditional doom metal genres (it especially sounds like something The Doors would do or even The Beatles\u2019 traditional doom metal experiment \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u201d), but there\u2019s not much that\u2019s good about it at all. The drum pattern from Maureen Tucker is about the only redeeming quality of this track, as the reliance on the bass drum to push the drum pattern was not only inventive, but it sounded really cool as well. Everything else about this track was absolutely garbage. The mixing on this song was horrendously awful (both on the vocals from Lou Reed and the instrumental [specifically the guitar from Sterling Morrison]), the electric guitar melody from Sterling Morrison was heavy, but it was boring, bland, and lifeless, the grating squeaky noises that went on throughout the track were dumb and sounded like a fiddle was mixed with someone\u2019s shoes squeaking on a basketball court, and the lyrics and vocals from Lou Reed are an entirely different kind of bad. This song\u2019s subject matter is sexual masochism. Yep, you heard that correctly. The lyrics on this song are God-awful and absolute cringe to listen to, and Lou Reed\u2019s harsh, husky, halting, and spoken flow for this song only makes it more cringy because he\u2019s off the beat (which is the overly repetitive and lifeless guitar instrumental) and his vocal delivery is so matter-of-fact and bland that it\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s reading from a script while singing. This song might\u2019ve been one of the heaviest tracks to be released at that point, but I\u2019m glad some other artists got on that soon after and topped this track.\u201cRun Run Run\u201d: This track sounds like a fusion of watered-down and bargain-brand blues rock combined with country / bluegrass music. The electric guitar melody on this track from Sterling Morrison is bouncy and bluesy, but it also has flourishes that sound like a country song or a bluegrass song. I hate bluegrass music with a burning passion, as it\u2019s pretty much everything I hate about country amplified into the most country-sounding country music. On this song, Lou Reed channels country music and bluegrass music in his lyrics, vocals, and flow. His lyrics sound like they could\u2019ve been taken from a Johnny Cash or Elvis Presley song, as they have a \u201crockabilly\u201d sound to them while also sounding like something from a Southern folk song, which is absolute and complete cringe, especially considering that Lou Reed is from New York City. The vocal delivery sounds like he\u2019s trying to do a watered-down and low-rent impression of Elvis Presley, and every part of Lou Reed\u2019s persona on this track sounds forced and disingenuous. At the very least, he\u2019s not doing his halting spoken flow on this song. The two guitar solos on this track are at earrape volume and sound like Lou Reed is playing as \u201cfast and loud\u201d as he possibly can with no regard for the basic electric guitar melody provided by Sterling Morrison or the guitar itself. These guitar solos are Busch Light in comparison to the Dom Perrignon that is Jimi Hendrix\u2019s guitar solos on all of his albums, two of which were released later in the same year that this album came out. They\u2019re fast, they\u2019re loud, but do they have any substance? They do not. This song is a disingenuous \u201cthrow stuff at the wall and see what sticks\u201d kind of track, and Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison, and John Cale (whose bassline is pretty much entirely drowned out on this song) threw stuff at the wall and completely missed the wall.\u201cAll Tomorrow\u2019s Parties\u201d: Nico on vocals again for this track. The production on this song is actually better than it\u2019s been for most of the album (with the exclusion of \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d which is apparently the needle in this haystack of garbage), as the booming, bass drum heavy, and pulsing drum pattern from Maureen Tucker is good, the electric guitar melody from Sterling Morrison is good and sounds like something Robby Krieger would do on The Doors\u2019 debut album (Sterling Morrison\u2019s electric guitar melody on this song actually sounds like Robby Krieger\u2019s work on \u201cThe End\u201d), and the mixing is not half bad on this track either. The keyboard melody from John Cale (who is normally the bassist) on this track is repetitive, bland, and overbearing, though, as it distracts from a lot of the better moments of this song. Nico\u2019s vocals make me long for Olivia Rodrigo and Alyssa Milano. That\u2019s how egregiously awful they are. If I was to give her a grade for her vocals, she would get an F undoubtedly, but she would probably get the first ever F- for vocals. Her voice absolutely sucks, and whomever told her she could sing and that she should sing on this cacophonous album is an idiot. On this song, Nico sounds like an army officer mixed with Yeat without auto-tune doing a bad impression of The Weeknd. Her voice is booming and loud one minute and quiet and attempting to sing softly in the next minute. It\u2019s cringy, and her lyrics on this song about a party girl who gets too drugged out and too fed up with her outfits to continue going to the parties and continuing to do drugs are cringy and likely autobiographical. This song is not nearly as bad as some of the others have been, but since Nico is on vocals on this song and really tries to overdo it with her singing, this track is awful.\u201cHeroin\u201d: Maureen Tucker does literally all she can to carry this track with her dynamic and powerful drumming, but it eventually gets old, as does the rest of this track after just over 7 minutes of the same thing for 8 verses. The drums start out soft and slow to accompany the rather basic but average at best electric guitar melody from Sterling Morrison, then they get faster to represent the climax of Lou Reed\u2019s usage of the titular drug heroin, then they get slower again to represent Lou Reed coming down after a high of using heroin. This concept was cool the first two times it was done, but after about ten times, it just gets old and sounds formulaic, trite, and contrived. The electric guitar melody stays the exact same and does not change the entire time the track is going on, which means 7 minutes of the same four chords played over and over again. It gets old very fast and gets extremely annoying. Lou Reed returns to the harsh, halting, talking flow on this song, and it\u2019s not as bad as it could be, but it\u2019s still really bad, as he\u2019s just talking, and though he might raise his voice a little bit during the climactic parts of this song, he\u2019s honestly just having a conversation with someone over an instrumental that\u2019s pretty stagnant and doesn\u2019t really do much besides play on one trope for the entire song. The lyrics are nihilistic and influenced by the addictive nature of heroin, which is nice for the overall concept of the song, but they\u2019re just not good. This track had promise when it started, but it eventually became a lowlight by dragging on for too long and being ridiculously repetitive.\u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d: Nico on vocals again, though I must say this song is significantly less grating than most of the other Nico vocal performances. On this track, she\u2019s at least somewhat tolerable with her vocals. The electric guitar melody from Sterling Morrison on this song is stellar; probably my favorite guitar melody so far on the album, as it\u2019s the most varied, dynamic, and non-repetitive one I\u2019ve heard yet on this album. It\u2019s definitely one that has a more upbeat and happy sound, which is probably part of the reason it\u2019s so appealing to me. The drum pattern from Maureen Tucker is also good on this track, as she does a good job holding it down and providing a reference point for Nico and the electric guitar melody. Nico still sounds pretentious and overblown on this track, and the concept of this song in the lyrics is one that was far better demonstrated by Justin Timberlake on \u201cMirrors,\u201d but this song is at least mid, so that\u2019s a slight win for Nico, I guess?\u201cThe Black Angel\u2019s Death Song\u201d: Oh, my word, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on with this track. This song sounds like Lou Reed tried to make a folk song but infused elements of country and bluegrass music with it, but absolutely failed entirely in every sense of the word and in every possible way he could\u2019ve failed on this track. The fiddle melody is ridiculously out of tune and has screeching, grating notes that sound absolutely abhorrent, the vocals, flows, and lyrics from Lou Reed make absolutely no sense, as he\u2019s completely off the beat the entire time and talking through the song in a way that sort of resembles Bob Dylan, but if Bob Dylan was mixed with Blueface and a guy who had just taken a mixture of cocaine and LSD (most likely Lou Reed). Nothing about this song makes any remote sense and it\u2019s actually one of the worst and most thoughtless songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life.Before I launch too far into the final thoughts for this album, I\u2019d like to first say that this album is ranked #15 (as of right now) on the Rate Your Music top albums of all time, and it holds the #1 spot for 1967. This album started out with a great song that I can definitely see myself coming back to. \u201cSunday Morning\u201d was a mellow, laid-back, low-key, and chill song about waking up the day after an all-nighter that perfectly captured the easygoing mood of a morning after a night filled with activity. The lush and calming vocals from Lou Reed, who gave his best vocal performance of the album on that track, paired with the psychedelic instrumental was amazing and perfectly representative of the great sounds of late 60\u2019s psychedelia. Now, this album came out at a time where music was irreversibly changing, and each album that was released redefined music and introduced new sounds that had never been attempted before in the history of music. This album did not achieve hardly any commercial success when it was released, as only about 5,000 copies were sold at the time of its release, and The Velvet Underground were considered \u201cunderground,\u201d as they were the passion project of Andy Warhol and the pop artist\u2019s attempt to influence music the same way he was influencing art. The same guy who said, \u201cIn the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes,\u201d is responsible for this abomination of sounds. \u201cSunday Morning\u201d is probably the most misleading intro track of all time, as it hyped me up for a sound that never appeared on this album. In fact, each track seemed to be uniquely bad and have bad things that the previous ones did not. Sure, this album had sounds of punk, indie rock, alternative rock, art rock, and even some progressive rock and jam band, but did it do any of those sounds well? It did not. This album may have laid the groundwork for those genres, but that\u2019s pretty much all it did. It laid the groundwork, then other musicians picked it up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do a song like The Velvet Underground, only actually good.\u201d This album might have had influence, but only because musicians allowed it to by citing it as inspiration. In truth, this album has some of the worst instrumentation and musicianship I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s psychedelia in the same way Generation Swine by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce is grunge. The guitar solos on this album are like drinking Busch Light in comparison to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s fine wine guitar solos that would be released on Are You Experienced and Axis: Bold As Love later in the same year. Lou Reed is a horrifically bad singer, as he just talks through the entire album except for on the track \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d which is a fluke with good vocals, and his harsh, halting, weird spoken flow is off-putting and cringy most of the time, especially when it\u2019s paired with heinously bad lyrics. As for Nico? She\u2019s an entirely different kind of bad. Although it has nothing to do with her musicianship, she\u2019s a German neo-Nazi who\u2019s a raving racist, and as a singer, she\u2019s probably the first artist ever to get an F- vocal grade for how actually awful her singing voice is. Her voice makes me long for the likes of Olivia Rodrigo and Alyssa Milano: That\u2019s how terrible she is. The final two tracks on this album are completely unlistenable because they\u2019re so horrendously awful and a slap in the face to good musicians who put out good music during the 1960\u2019s and 1967, specifically. Overall, this album does not deserve its place on the all-time chart at #15, and it MOST DEFINITELY DOES NOT deserve to be ranked over Are You Experienced by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, one of the greatest albums ever made, The Doors\u2019 self-titled debut album, or Axis: Bold As Love by The Jimi Hendrix Experience for 1967.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 1, 2023Genres: Shoegaze, PopTracks:shanty \u2013 9.3alife \u2013 8.8andalucia plays \u2013 7.5kisses \u2013 7.7skin in the game \u2013 7chained to a cloud \u2013 10the slab \u2013 7.4[Instrumental track \u201cprayer remembered\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cshanty\u201d: Production on this song is outstanding. This track sounds like what would happen if Chris Lowe, the keyboardist and producer for Pet Shop Boys, worked with Slowdive on their album Souvlaki. The song starts off with a long, melancholy, pulsing, and downtempo synth intro from Neil Halstead, which then transitions into a distorted, grainy, and shoegaze guitar riff from Christian Savill, which is further accompanied by an excellent drum pattern from Simon Scott. Neil Halstead continues throughout the track to deliver an epic and downtempo synth melody that sounds like it could\u2019ve been the work of Chris Lowe on a Pet Shop Boys album, while Simon Scott continues with an amazing drum pattern that grounds the sprawling and pulsing synth melody. Christian Savill comes in every once in a while with distorted guitar tones that are reminiscent of the shoegaze \u201cwall of sound\u201d production style of Slowdive\u2019s Souvlaki album, and they\u2019re amazingly executed. Based on the production alone, this song sounds like a mix between synthpop / new wave (i.e. in the style of bands like Depeche Mode, New Order, and Pet Shop Boys) and Slowdive\u2019s brand of shoegaze that they demonstrated on Souvlaki. Now, the production on this song warrants a 10, but the lyrics and vocals don\u2019t. Rachel Goswell and Neil Halstead, in an attempt to create a dreamy, psychedelic, shoegaze soundscape on this song, have sparse vocals and mostly unintelligible lyrics that sound phoned-in. They sound like they know the production is gonna carry the song, so they don\u2019t put forth hardly any effort. Their mid performances are the only thing that keeps this song from getting a 10. Slowdive is off to a very good start with this song, and I\u2019m eager to hear more.\u201calife\u201d: Once again, the production on this song is amazing. The electric guitar melody from Christian Savill on this song is laid-back, mellow, low-key, and lo-fi, and the soft sound it has is amazing and impeccable for creating a chill sound for this song. The drum pattern from Simon Scott is absolutely incredible; he\u2019s definitely improved a lot as a drummer since Souvlaki, as his laid-back, low-key, and lo-fi drumming on this song sounds relaxed and natural. I don\u2019t feel comfortable rating drummers and listing my favorite drummers because I don\u2019t feel that the drums are an instrument like the keyboard (in any form), the guitar, or the bass in that drummers don\u2019t really get to express a lot of emotion or individuality with their craft, but Simon Scott has been making an effort to stand out on this album, and I\u2019m recognizing that he\u2019s trying to show how much he\u2019s improved. The vocals from Rachel Goswell on this song aren\u2019t good, as her verses are mid and her lyrics are unintelligible, but Neil Halstead did a great job with his vocals on this song. His lyrics weren\u2019t entirely clear, but most of them could be understood, and he\u2019s also improved a great deal since Souvlaki in terms of vocals. I\u2019m actually enjoying him more on this album as a vocalist than I\u2019m enjoying Rachel Goswell, which is a definite first. The keyboards from Neil Halstead on this song are more subtle and further in the background than they were on the intro, but he still did a good job with them. Neil Halstead and Simon Scott are running the show right now, so let\u2019s see if that continues. Good song.\u201candalucia plays\u201d: This song has been the first track where lyrics and vocals from Neil Halstead are taking front and center and haven\u2019t been part of an attempted psychedelic and shoegaze / dream pop soundscape. The lyrics on this song are extremely conceptual and abstract and sound like something that would be on a song by The Cure or Kate Bush\u2019s 50 Words For Snow album. The vocals from Neil Halstead on this song are husky, deep, and melancholy, and they\u2019re definitely the forefront of the song. Although the vocals are good enough, I don\u2019t like the lyrics. The overly conceptual and abstract nature of them makes it hard to determine what the song is about, and while the lyrics on the other songs have been indeterminate, the fact that they\u2019re the focal point of this song and I still can\u2019t understand what Neil Halstead is talking about is a problem. Production on this song is minimalist and based on an acoustic-sounding electric guitar from Christian Savill, an extremely subtle yet constant drum pattern from Simon Scott, and a bassline from Nick Chaplin that is just kinda there. It\u2019s cool to finally hear bassist Nick Chaplin on one of these songs, but he didn\u2019t do much of anything for this track. I like how Slowdive tried to make a song that was influenced by art pop and tried to make lyrics the focal point, but Neil Halstead couldn\u2019t make a good track just focusing on lyrics and his vocals.\u201ckisses\u201d: Neil Halstead\u2019s vocals were pretty good on this song, but everything else was mid. The flanged electric guitar melody from Christian Savill suffered from being \u201ctoo chill,\u201d if you will, as its mellow, laid-back, and low-key sound was more melancholy than simply mellow. The drum pattern from Simon Scott was barely noticeable on this song, and the track suffered from not having strong enough drums. The keyboard sound effects from Rachel Goswell were cool, but they were fleeting and not in the song nearly enough. The backing vocals from Rachel Goswell were also not good, as I preferred Neil Halstead\u2019s vocals on the verses, and I almost wished that he had done the chorus by himself. The lyrics from Neil Halstead on the verses and chorus were alright, nothing too special, and pretty cliche stuff for an art pop song or a shoegaze track where the lyrics aren\u2019t all that important. The production on this song is average, the lyrics are mid, and the electric guitar melody from Christian Savill was mid, but the vocals from Neil Halstead were alright enough, so the song earns a few points for that.\u201cskin in the game\u201d: This song brings back the shoegaze sound from Slowdive\u2019s Souvlaki album with a wall of sound production technique, heavy reverb, heavy effects, and heavy distortion on the bass guitar. Normally, the electric guitar from Christian Savill would be the one that was distorted, but on this track, Nick Chaplin\u2019s bass guitar receives the grainy distortion of the amplifier that Slowdive often used on Souvlaki to achieve the wall of sound production style on most of those songs. The flanged electric guitar melody from Christian Savill is pushed to the side on this track in favor of Neil Halstead\u2019s vocals and the grainy, distorted bass guitar of Nick Chaplin, but it isn\u2019t that big of a deal because the electric guitar melody wasn\u2019t that great anyway. The lyrics are extremely conceptual and abstract, which makes them hard to follow and difficult to understand, and the vocals from both Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell are mid, with Neil Halstead\u2019s being mid at best. The vocal gymnastics he attempts to do on his verses and on the chorus are just flat-out ridiculous, as he sounds like a pitched-down version of Dennis DeYoung from Styx on one of Styx\u2019s gaudy, overblown, and pretentious symphonic-sounding tracks. The grainy and distorted bass from Nick Chaplin is alright and calls back to a different era of Slowdive, but it\u2019s ultimately not great and a lame attempt to replicate the sound from Souvlaki.\u201cchained to a cloud\u201d: The ethereality of this song is unmatched. The song begins with a downtempo yet medium pitch synth melody from Neil Halstead that goes on for at least a minute and is eventually accompanied by a great drum pattern from Simon Scott that helps move the synths along while also being epic in its own right. This instrumental intro is absolutely awesome, and it eventually transitions into vocals from Rachel Goswell that are soft, spacey, and ethereal. They\u2019re not some of her best vocals, as her best vocal performances were undoubtedly on Souvlaki (from what I\u2019ve heard from Slowdive), but they were better than anything she\u2019d done on the album thus far. Neil Halstead follows her with some great vocals that absolutely match the tone of this song and are some of his best vocals on the album so far. The questioning nature of the lyrics is great on this song, as the song seems to lift higher into the clouds with the spacey melody with each question posed by Neil Halstead & Rachel Goswell on the verses. There are a few distorted bass guitar tones and some grainy electric guitar courtesy of Nick Chaplin and Christian Savill on this song, but they\u2019re pretty infrequent and spaced out through the instrumental break, meaning that Neil Halstead on keyboard and Simon Scott on drums are once again the stars of the show on this album. I\u2019m glad the album returned to that format because its best two songs showcased Neil Halstead and Simon Scott, and now the album\u2019s first perfect 10 has done the same. Excellent song.\u201cthe slab\u201d: The electric guitar melody from Christian Savill on this song was average. He played an alright melody, but it resembled a faster-paced version of the song \u201cMachine Gun\u201d from Souvlaki, and the electric guitar sounded the same on this song as it did on most of the other mid tracks from this album. The drum pattern from Simon Scott on this song was boring and took a backseat to the electric guitar melody. On this song, Neil Halstead and Simon Scott were not the stars of the show, as this track focused mostly on some distorted guitar noises and an electric guitar melody that was rather repetitive and punctuated only a few times by some drums from Simon Scott. The vocals on this song from Neil Halstead were essentially just mumbling, and normally that wouldn\u2019t be a problem for a Slowdive song, but the production on this track was mid. This song sounds like a half-baked attempt to close an album that had many of the same sounds that were present on this track, but those sounds were better executed on those other songs.Going into 2023, I had no idea what the genre of shoegaze was or who Slowdive was. Now, I find myself reviewing their sixth album, released in 2023, 40 years after the only other album I\u2019ve heard from them: Souvlaki, which was released in 1993. Souvlaki was my introduction to the shoegaze genre that Slowdive does so well (the genre is explained in more capacity on that review): A mix of heavy reverb, heavy distortion, dreamy vocals, usually unintelligible lyrics, heavy use of effects to vocals and instruments, and a wall of sound production technique. This album is not as representative of the shoegaze sound as Souvlaki is, but it still showcases Slowdive\u2019s ability to make solid tracks by using these techniques. On this album, Slowdive opted for a much more pop-infused sound, making a mix of psychedelia, shoegaze, and pop that\u2019s referred to commonly as \u201cdream pop\u201d for its dreamy and ethereal sounds. This album was at its best when Neil Halstead\u2019s vocals and keyboard work and Simon Scott\u2019s drums were spotlighted. The three best songs on this album \u201cshanty,\u201d a synthpop-meets-shoegaze song where Neil Halstead took over the song with his amazing keyboard playing and good vocals, \u201calife,\u201d a mellow and laid-back song where Simon Scott showcased his drumming skills and Neil Halstead showed just how much he\u2019d improved as a vocalist from Souvlaki while Rachel Goswell\u2026 was also on the song, and \u201cchained to a cloud,\u201d the most ethereal and dreamy song on the album where Neil Halstead did an amazing job with keyboards and Simon Scott brought it home with low-key and lo-fi drums that accompanied the keyboard perfectly, all played to the strengths of Neil Halstead and Simon Scott. Most of the mid tracks on this album were brought about by lyrical shortcomings by Neil Halstead (\u201candalucia plays\u201d), mid guitar work from Christian Savill (really any of the mid songs), or vocal shortcomings from Rachel Goswell (even Neil Halstead had some vocal shortcomings on \u201cskin in the game\u201d). This album also faltered when Slowdive attempted to replicate the shoegaze sound they cultivated on Souvlaki. \u201cskin in the game\u201d was a perfect example of how Slowdive has moved on from their Souvlaki sound but were forced to attempt to replicate it. Overall, this album has a few high points, but it won\u2019t take the album of the year spot away from Travis Scott\u2019s masterpiece UTOPIA, and probably won\u2019t even touch the AOTY runner-ups Diamonds & Dancefloors by Ava Max and Metro Boomin\u2019s Across The Spider-Verse soundtrack. An okay album overall.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 7, 1987Genres: Synthpop, New WaveTracks:One More Chance \u2013 8.1What Have I Done To Deserve This?

The song is a little over 5 and a half minutes long, so taking out the first 1:24 would hardly hurt it. The instrumental intro that lasts a little over a minute is unnecessary, weird, and doesn\u2019t play to Chris Lowe\u2019s production strengths at all. Chris Lowe is a master of the keyboard, specifically the synthesizer, so where is the synth? Instead, this instrumental intro has nothing but weird, mechanical \u201ceh-eh\u201d vocal samples, drums that sound like bongos, and car screeching sound effects. Neil Tennant\u2019s first verse is on this ridiculous and weird beat, and his pseudo-spoken word flow only serves to increase the cringe. The lyrics aren\u2019t good and neither are his vocals. However, at the 1:24 point, Chris Lowe saves himself by coming in with lush synth chords to back Neil Tennant on the pre-chorus, and they lead into the chorus brilliantly, where his bass guitar riff sounds like it\u2019s borrowed from Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train,\u201d and it\u2019s really well applied to synthpop. The second verse from Neil Tennant is better, although it\u2019s not great, as the drum pattern from Chris Lowe sounds like maracas shaking, and Neil Tennant\u2019s pseudo-spoken word deadpan vocal delivery doesn\u2019t exactly work well over it either. However, the pre-chorus and chorus are smashes, though, and they undoubtedly make up for the less than ideal verses. The third verse from Neil Tennant is undoubtedly the worst one, though, as his shortcomings as a vocalist are really displayed with this verse. He abandons the pseudo-spoken word flow in favor of singing, and it just does not work. The final chorus definitely brings the song together, though, and Chris Lowe holds it down alright enough for the outro. It\u2019s not the best intro, but it\u2019s good at the very least.\u201cWhat Have I Done To Deserve This? (feat. Dusty Springfield)\u201d: An interesting collab that\u2019s pretty much the last thing I expected from Pet Shop Boys. Pet Shop Boys, an 80\u2019s British synthpop / new wave group, recruited Dusty Springfield, a 60\u2019s British soul singer who was heavily influenced by American Motown artists like Aretha Franklin, to feature on this track, which is a back-and-forth narrative track about a relationship (much like The Human League\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t You Want Me\u201d). The production from Chris Lowe on this song is outstanding. The eclectic drum pattern mixes extremely well with the triumphant and bright-sounding synth melodies, and his use of trumpets during some of Dusty Springfield\u2019s sections are a great homage to Dusty\u2019s 60\u2019s soul music in a way that sounds like synthpop. The verses from Neil Tennant & Dusty Springfield (who go back and forth like boyfriend and girlfriend on the verses) are good, but unfortunately, Dusty Springfield\u2019s age shows on this track. She sounds old and her vocals don\u2019t match the synthpop style of this song very well. The chorus from Neil Tennant is also average at best, as his pseudo-spoken word deadpan vocal delivery sounds mundane and boring, and while Dusty Springfield attempts to pick up some of that slack on the post-chorus, her vocals sound out-of-place and a bit off-putting after Neil Tennant. However, Neil Tennant sang on the verses and did a very good job. Overall, this song is good, but it\u2019s perhaps not what Pet Shop Boys were going for when they recruited Dusty Springfield.\u201cShopping\u201d: Everything after 2:22 on this song can be entirely eliminated. The trumpets from Chris Lowe, Neil Tennant attempting to harmonize with the vocal sample with a cringy, squeaky, and nasally voice, and the repetition of the annoying and sort of cringy chorus \u201cWe\u2019re S-H-O-P.P.-I-N-G, we\u2019re shopping\u201d are all parts of the song that absolutely did not need to be included. Despite the cringe that takes place for the last minute of the song, this track is good. It\u2019s a political commentary on the British political system from Pet Shop Boys, as it insinuates that rich people control the government by buying the loyalty of politicians and spending money to get laws passed. The verses from Neil Tennant are very good, as he sounds like a combination of David Bowie and his normal pseudo-spoken word flow. They have some of the best vocals I\u2019ve heard from Neil Tennant, and the lyrics are good too. The production from Chris Lowe is very good for the first part of the track, as the synth chords that back the main melody (which is constantly changing to fit the mood of the song) are great, and the constantly changing melody is an amazing example of production that works with the lyrics and vocals. Although this song stunk it up in the last minute and had a lame chorus, it was good overall.\u201cHit Music\u201d: A perfect example of why satirical music doesn\u2019t work. This song is supposed to be a satire of 80\u2019s dance pop commercial hits, and while parodying those songs, it is also an 80\u2019s dance pop track. This song is absolutely horrendous, as the lyrics have no substance whatsoever, Neil Tennant\u2019s vocals are blander and more deadpan than they\u2019ve ever been, and the production from Chris Lowe has no substance to it either and sounds like a Joey Carbone beat from an Alyssa Milano album. This song is absolutely awful and in no way indicative of Pet Shop Boys' talent or normal style of music. It\u2019s complete garbage.\u201cIt Couldn\u2019t Happen Here\u201d: Wow, this album very quickly went from pretty good to terrible. This song is Pet Shop Boys attempt at gaudy, orchestral, and pretentious baroque pop, and it\u2019s a total and complete failure. Neil Tennant\u2019s vocals are pretentious and snobby while his lyrics are abstract and conceptual (it\u2019s as if he\u2019s trying to sound like Kate Bush on this track and failing), and Chris Lowe\u2019s production includes heavy use of orchestral instruments like violin, cello, and others to create a baroque sound that sounds more like snobby orchestral music than an elegant and lush beat. This song was potentially an attempt at continuing the elegant sound first cultivated on Pet Shop Boys' amazing song \u201cWest End Girls\u201d from their debut album, but it ended up sounding like the most overblown and stuck-up orchestral song ever. What an egregious L.\u201cIt\u2019s A Sin\u201d: More like \u201cIt\u2019s A Ten.\u201d As much as \u201cWest End Girls\u201d is the quintessential Pet Shop Boys song, this one is as well. This track, with its timidly triumphant synth instrumental that fuses overblown orchestral elements with mechanical synth melodies (timidly triumphant is a bit oxymoronic, but the mood that Chris Lowe creates on this track with his production is one of triumph with a question mark after it), is definitely the best one so far on this album. The vocals from Neil Tennant mix singing with pseudo-spoken word delivery, and while Chris Lowe is going insanely hard with the synths, Neil Tennant\u2019s voice seems to be the anchor for this track. The Christian theme of the lyrics mixes well with Neil Tennant\u2019s regretful yet carefree tone to create a great track about the forgiveness of sins and how while humans aren\u2019t perfect, we are still loved by God. This song is also about Neil Tennant\u2019s struggles with his sexuality, as in the 80\u2019s, many people thought being homosexual was sinful, and it was not as accepted then as it is today. This song is great and perhaps one of the most introspective and lyrically powerful songs by Pet Shop Boys.\u201cI Want To Wake Up\u201d: Production from Chris Lowe on this track is outstanding. The synth bassline, synth chords, main synth melody, and drum pattern all have a brilliant electronic and mechanical sound that creates an amazing instrumental. The drum pattern is subtle and doesn\u2019t make that much of an impact, but its existence grounds the track and gives the synths something to revolve around. The lyrics and vocals from Neil Tennant sound more like they\u2019d belong on an art pop track than on a synthpop track, but with Chris Lowe\u2019s production and his pseudo-spoken word flow, he makes the lyrics sound great for a Pet Shop Boys song. The chorus is mid at best, as Neil Tennant makes it sound obnoxious and pretentious with the way he delivers it, but his verses, especially the lyrics on the verses, are great. Neil Tennant expresses his reluctance and excitement surrounding falling in love, and his lyrics, which include a reference to Soft Cell\u2019s \u201cTainted Love,\u201d are great. This song is good and a step in the right direction for Pet Shop Boys.\u201cHeart\u201d: A brilliant fusion of Pet Shop Boys style synthpop (the spliced, chopped vocal sample and the lush synth chords) with late 70\u2019s early 80\u2019s-era post-disco (the drum pattern, fast-paced and choppy synth melody, and flow from Neil Tennant) by Chris Lowe on the production of this song. Neil Tennant\u2019s airy and breathy \u201cbeat, heartbeat\u201d throughout the song is an amazing touch and helps fuse post-disco with Pet Shop Boys style synthpop, and it goes really well with the lush synth chords. Neil Tennant\u2019s lyrics about being in love and having his heart skip a beat whenever he sees the person he loves are great, but his vocals and flows on this track leave a bit to be desired. Chris Lowe brings in a variety of sounds on this song and undoubtedly modernizes the 70\u2019s sound of disco with his synth melodies and drum pattern on this song. This track sounds like something Giorgio Moroder would make, but applied to the late 80\u2019s and Pet Shop Boys synthpop. A great track, definitely one of the best ones on the album.Pet Shop Boys' second album (released a year after their debut album Please in 1986) is another 10-track album with a single 10. However, this album was less feast-or-famine than Please, as it had four songs in the 8-9 \u201cgood\u201d range, and overall more good songs than Please, as it had more hits than misses. Although, some of these hits were tracks like \u201cOne More Chance\u201d & \u201cShopping,\u201d where entire sections of the song could\u2019ve been completely eliminated and the songs barely got ratings in the 8-9 range (the first one got 8.1, the second one got 8.2). The album started out pretty good with \u201cOne More Chance\u201d & \u201cShopping\u201d barely escaping with good ratings and Pet Shop Boys' odd but cool collaboration with 60\u2019s British soul singer Dusty Springfield being a success. Dusty Springfield may have been out of her element with this song, but she made the best of it and Pet Shop Boys got a good song out of it. After \u201cShopping\u201d though, the album took a drastic turn for the worse with the cynical and cryptic \u201cRent,\u201d followed by the satirical and dumb \u201cHit Music\u201d that sounded like it could\u2019ve been on an Alyssa Milano album and \u201cIt Couldn\u2019t Happen Here,\u201d which was Pet Shop Boys' misguided attempt at orchestral baroque pop. However, after that, Pet Shop Boys rebounded with the banger \u201cIt\u2019s A Sin,\u201d a track as quintessential for their sound as \u201cWest End Girls\u201d from the previous album, then followed it up with \u201cI Want To Wake Up,\u201d a song inspired by art pop that where a lovesick Neil Tennant resembled Kate Bush or Depeche Mode\u2019s Dave Gahan with vocals and lyrics. The chorus wasn\u2019t good on that song, but Neil Tennant surprised me with his emotional lyrics. \u201cHeart\u201d was the album\u2019s second-best song, a great track where Chris Lowe pieced together fragments of disco and combined them with synthpop to create a dance banger, and \u201cKing\u2019s Cross\u201d was a second failed outro track that sounded like filler much like \u201cWhy Don\u2019t We Live Together?\u201d from Please. This album definitely has more good songs than Pet Shop Boys debut, but the low floor for songs on here makes me think the rating won\u2019t reflect that. With this album, Pet Shop Boys continue to prove themselves as a driving force in synthpop and new wave.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released March 24, 1986Genres: Synthpop, New WaveTracks:Two Divided By Zero \u2013 9.4West End Girls \u2013 10Opportunities (Let\u2019s Make Lots Of Money) \u2013 6.9Love Comes Quickly \u2013 9.8Suburbia \u2013 7.2Tonight Is Forever \u2013 7.6Violence \u2013 9.6I Want A Lover \u2013 6.6Later Tonight \u2013 7Why Don\u2019t We Live Together? \u2013 6.7[Semi-instrumental track \u201cOpportunities (Let\u2019s Make Lots Of Money) (Reprise)\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cTwo Divided By Zero\u201d: This track may not be perfect, but it\u2019s great and it\u2019s an awesome introduction to Pet Shop Boys that showcases their musical style perfectly. The track may not do much to introduce lead vocalist Neil Tennant and producer / keyboardist / multi-instrumentalist Chris Lowe as individuals, but is shows off their songwriting skills and their ability to tell a story within a song. From the opening bouncy \u201cboing-ing\u201d synths and fast-paced drums that transition after a few seconds into an array of lush synth chords, I can see how talented Chris Lowe is as a keyboardist and how much he understands the genres of synthpop and new wave, and how he\u2019s using his talent and understanding to carve out a distinct sound for Pet Shop Boys in these genres. The production on this song is amazing, as Chris Lowe\u2019s chord progressions with his lush synth chords are powerful and complex, and the drums almost feel like an extension of Neil Tennant\u2019s flow on the verses. The lyrics are very good, as the subject matter of this song is a cryptic description of a murder and the two suspects (Neil Tennant and his lover) fleeing the scene of the crime (hence the title, dividing two suspects into none), but Neil Tennant is not the best vocalist. Instead of singing on this track, he uses a pseudo-spoken word flow on his verses. However, it doesn\u2019t matter because it works really well on this song. Chris Lowe obviously understands the vocal limitations of Neil Tennant, so he plays to the lead singer\u2019s strengths with this instrumental. The only part of the song that\u2019s not good is the chopped and spliced vocal sample that says \u201ctwo divided by zero\u201d throughout the song (it serves as the chorus). The breakdown where this sample is sped up and further chopped is the worst part of the song, as it sounds like the outro to Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cSIRENS.\u201d Great song, but a few things could\u2019ve been improved.\u201cWest End Girls\u201d: The perfect and quintessential Pet Shop Boys song. This song fuses so many of my favorite genres and musical sounds, and it\u2019s such an amazing song to represent Pet Shop Boys' musical style and who they are as individuals. The laid-back, low-key, and lo-fi production from Chris Lowe that includes downtempo synth, subtle yet constant drums, and horn flourishes is absolutely incredible, and it serves to make this song a fusion of synthpop, sophisti-pop, and elegant pop that works excellently. The lyrics from Neil Tennant are cryptic and ambiguous, but they\u2019re very good and his flow and vocal delivery on the verses and chorus is exceptional. Neil Tennant uses the same pseudo-spoken word flow on the verses, but just like on the intro track, it works really well and his vocal limitations don\u2019t matter. The chorus doesn\u2019t exactly have the largest vocal range, but again, it doesn\u2019t matter because Neil Tennant\u2019s vocals are so smooth and sultry that the limited range is erroneous. The song has multiple interpretations: Crushing on hot and sophisticated girls (which is the interpretation I like best), being on the run from a bad relationship, or the opposites attract principle in relationships; all of which are demonstrated by the geography of Pet Shop Boys' native city of London. Amazing song.\u201cOpportunities (Let\u2019s Make Lots Of Money)\u201d: This song is the first time on this album where both Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have missed. The production from Chris Lowe is incredibly disjointed, cacophonous, and sounds like a mashup of a bunch of different 80\u2019s synthpop sounds. This instrumental has so many changes and infusions of different synth sounds that it sounds muddied and confusing; there\u2019s no distinct Pet Shop Boys sound to this track; it honestly sounds more like something from Kate Bush\u2019s Hounds Of Love than from this album. Neil Tennant\u2019s lyrics and vocals are mid at best on this song, as the chorus of \u201cI\u2019ve got the brains, you\u2019ve got the looks / Let\u2019s make lots of money / You\u2019ve got the brawn, I\u2019ve got the brains / Let\u2019s make lots of money\u201d is horribly and gratingly annoying, especially when it\u2019s delivered in Neil Tennant\u2019s deadpan vocals. The lyrics in the verses are mid as well, but at least Neil Tennant\u2019s vocal delivery is a bit better, as his pseudo-spoken word flow works pretty well again despite the disjointed and cacophonous production. This song is supposed to be one of Pet Shop Boys' major commercial hits, but this song is not good.\u201cLove Comes Quickly\u201d: Brilliant fusion of synthpop and elegant pop. The synth melody from Chris Lowe is constant, pulsing, low-pitched, and acts sort of like a bassline, which makes the airy synth chords he scatters through the track and the vocal samples that much more impactful. It\u2019s a smooth synthpop instrumental that sounds like a precursor to more flushed-out elegant pop songs that were made in the 2010\u2019s by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, and others. The vocals and lyrics from Neil Tennant on this track are very good, and absolutely outstanding on the chorus. He really pushes the boundaries of what he\u2019s done already on this album with smooth, sultry, and mellow vocals that have him holding notes and expanding outside his defined vocal range. It\u2019s an awesome chorus, but the verses aren\u2019t as successful for him. The first verse is good; gets off to a rocky start, but it\u2019s good; the second verse is great; definitely the best one on the song; but the third verse is average at best and it\u2019s definitely the weakest link of the track and the reason it\u2019s not a 10. This song is incredible and awesome, as Neil Tennant gives an encouraging message to all those who have given up on love that they will find it, but the third verse could\u2019ve been better.\u201cSuburbia\u201d: Weird and disingenuous song. The main synth melody from Chris Lowe sounds like the Wii login music in the blandest way possible, and the surrounding synths aren\u2019t much better. The spliced-in sound effects of what sounds like war and riot noises during the instrumental breaks throughout the song are also weird and out-of-place. The vocals from Neil Tennant on this song have returned to being his normal pseudo-spoken word flow on both the verses and the chorus, and the lyrics on this song sound like a total rip-off of \u201cPleasant Valley Sunday\u201d by The Monkees and \u201cOur House\u201d by Madness, as Pet Shop Boys are making a bunch of thinly veiled and surface-level critiques about the suburban lifestyle that are nothing new and all things other artists have said before. The lyrics are trite, contrived, and cliche, and the lyrics on the chorus don\u2019t make any sense. The production is painstakingly mid and flavorless, and Neil Tennant\u2019s vocals and lyrics aren\u2019t far from that either.\u201cViolence\u201d: Production from Chris Lowe on this song is outstanding. The flanged synths on the melody, the deep reverb-heavy synth chords, the fast-paced kick drums, and the vocal samples and distortions of Neil Tennant\u2019s vocals on the break after the chorus are all brilliantly executed and a true testament to how talented Chris Lowe is not just as a keyboardist but as a multi-instrumentalist. Neil Tennant\u2019s first verse is good at best, but it\u2019s nothing special, and that\u2019s why the song isn\u2019t rated higher. That first verse has lyrics and vocals that aren\u2019t up to the standards that Neil Tennant later defines on this song. Once the first chorus hits, everything Neil Tennant delivers on this awesome beat by Chris Lowe is amazing, but that first verse is the only thing that holds this song back from greatness. This song\u2019s subject matter and lyrics that tell a story about a man and his brother who do violent acts to pass their time but give love to their families when they get home are great, and the juxtaposition of love and violence is presented brilliantly by Neil Tennant on the verses. Great song.\u201cLater Tonight\u201d: Total filler. This song isn\u2019t representative of Pet Shop Boys' musical style or skills at all. The acoustic piano melody mixed with the lush and light synth chords is a nice contrast, but the piano melody sounds like a bargain-brand version of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gig In The Sky (feat. Clare Torry),\u201d and the synth chords don\u2019t do nearly enough to assign the Pet Shop Boys signature synthpop sound to the song. Vocals and lyrics from Neil Tennant on this song are half-baked and phoned-in, as he puts the smallest amount of effort possible into them while still having them be passable. It\u2019s a shame that an album with such great songs on it like \u201cWest End Girls,\u201d \u201cLove Comes Quickly,\u201d and \u201cViolence\u201d has to have painstakingly mid filler songs like this one on it.This album got off to a great start, but eventually fizzled out and became mid in its later tracks. The album started strong with \u201cTwo Divided By Zero,\u201d a great song that provided a great introduction to Pet Shop Boys' style (i.e. both Chris Howe\u2019s production and Neil Tennant\u2019s vocals and lyrics), then got its only 10 with the amazing smash hit banger \u201cWest End Girls,\u201d which might be my all-time favorite Pet Shop Boys song, but I\u2019d probably need to hear more of their stuff to make that claim more valid. Although \u201cOpportunities (Let\u2019s Make Lots Of Money)\u201d wasn\u2019t a good song, it was at least a commercial hit for Pet Shop Boys that helped support this album\u2019s main single and best song \u201cWest End Girls.\u201d That song was then followed by \u201cLove Comes Quickly,\u201d which was a brilliant downtempo synthpop song that undoubtedly contributed to the sound that would become late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s sophisti-pop, as well as elegant pop as we know it today. Pet Shop Boys opened this album on a heater, but when the dull and uninventive \u201cSuburbia\u201d hit, the album wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cViolence\u201d was a dark horse banger that was a great song I really enjoyed, but every song around it was boring filler and very basic dance-pop that sounded like cookie-cutter songs to please the record label. These songs in the latter half of the album didn\u2019t sound like Pet Shop Boys and sounded more like they were trying to score a few one-off potential singles that would maybe gain some airplay in the clubs. Although Pet Shop Boys might have missed more than they hit on this album, the amount of potential both Neil Tennant & Chris Lowe displayed was staggering. Neil Tennant\u2019s technical, mechanical, and odd pseudo-spoken word flow he used throughout this album seemed weird at first, but it works really well for Pet Shop Boys' style of synthpop. Chris Lowe is amazing with the keyboards on this album, and while not every keyboard melody or preset results in a good beat, he\u2019s clearly playing around and seeing what fits, which I can admire. This album is the kind of synthpop Alyssa Milano was trying to make (but failed to make) on her albums Alyssa through Do You See Me?, and I can understand why she would want to attempt this style of synthpop. It\u2019s unbelievable if done right, but if done wrong, it can end up sounding mid and boring (like it did on this album) or just flat out bad (like it did on Alyssa Milano\u2019s albums). This album has some amazing songs, but unfortunately, not enough to make it a completely solid project.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 1, 1978Genres: AOR, Classic Rock, Art RockTracks:Great White Hope \u2013 9.3I\u2019m O.K. \u2013 8Sing For The Day \u2013 6.7Lords Of The Ring \u2013 7.1Blue Collar Man (Long Nights) \u2013 10Queen Of Spades \u2013 10Renegade \u2013 10Pieces Of Eight \u2013 9.6[Instrumental tracks \u201cThe Message\u201d & \u201cAku-Aku\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d: Bassist Chuck Panozzo and his brother drummer John Panozzo are the stars of the show on this song. The drumming from John Panozzo on this track is so unbelievably cool and complex that it distracts from the electric guitar parts from Tommy Shaw and the vocals from Dennis DeYoung, and the bassline from his brother Chuck Panozzo is equally as epic and complex, and the two pair together beautifully to form a fast, intricate, hard rock instrumental. Now, those guys definitely stole the show with their performances on here, but everyone else did pretty well too. The opening electric guitar riff from Tommy Shaw reminds me of Boston, but later in the track, he brings in his own sound and sounds more natural. His guitar riffs on the verses and chorus are good, but they kinda take a backseat to the masterful bassline and drum pattern from Chuck and John Panozzo, respectively. Tommy Shaw gets his chance to shine a bit more with his guitar solo, which is good, but not one of his best. The vocals from Dennis DeYoung on this song are mostly good, but the chorus sounds a bit overblown at times and the flows and vocal delivery on the verses sometimes falters. The lyrics detailing the life story of a boxer is pretty good and Dennis DeYoung does a pretty good job presenting that story on the verses (less so on the chorus). J.Y. does a great job with the keyboard flourishes after the chorus, but his keyboard solo that follows Tommy Shaw\u2019s guitar solo is mid and reminiscent of the goofiness from The Grand Illusion. Overall, this intro track is very strong.\u201cI\u2019m O.K.\u201d: A light miss for Styx that just falls short of being good. The electric guitar melody from Tommy Shaw is average at best on this song, as he uses some pretty basic AOR riffs on the verses and chorus, and his electric guitar solo is better (it\u2019s definitely good), but it\u2019s still not his best work. His electric guitar work gets better as the track progresses, and he sounds his best on the final chorus which leads into the outro, but he got off to a rocky start and didn\u2019t bring his A game on this song. Dennis DeYoung\u2019s lyrics and vocals are average, as his lyrics are cookie-cutter, basic, and formulaic (not much substance to them, just the overall message of \u201cI\u2019m doing alright\u201d), and his vocals on the verses and chorus are average; he tries to sound theatrical and grandiose on the chorus, but alongside Tommy Shaw\u2019s lackluster guitar playing, he falls short. J.Y. isn\u2019t a very good addition to this track either, as he uses both the organ and the synthesizer for keyboard sounds on this song, and neither of them work particularly well. The melodies and solos are both average from him on here. It\u2019s a soft miss for Styx, but still a miss.\u201cSing For The Day\u201d: Lyrics and vocals from Dennis DeYoung on the verses are good, but the keyboard melodies and solos from J.Y. on this song make it sound like it could be in a Lucky Charms commercial. This song has an Irish jig leprechaun Lucky Charms type beat. The keyboard work from J.Y. on this song is absolutely abysmal, and it\u2019s not helped by Dennis DeYoung\u2019s flow and vocal cadence on the chorus. Dennis DeYoung sounds like the leprechaun from the Lucky Charms commercials on that chorus; it\u2019s the one part of the song where he totally fails vocally and lyrically. This song might\u2019ve been mildly good if not for the chorus and the horrendous Irish jig type beat.\u201cLords Of The Ring\u201d: Gaudy, overblown, pretentious, and orchestral-sounding art rock song with a story that\u2019s a knock-off of Lord Of The Rings. The electric guitar melody and solo from Tommy Shaw on this track are good, but Tommy Shaw is the only person who did well on this track. The vocals from Dennis DeYoung are pretentious, symphonic-sounding, and clearly indicate that he\u2019s taking this song too seriously, and the lyrics, as I mentioned, are just a knock-off version of Lord Of The Rings. The keyboard work from J.Y. is not quite as egregious on this track as it was on the previous one, but he didn\u2019t improve that much, as he way overdid it with gaudy and overdone synth melodies and a synth solo that tried too hard to sound orchestral. This song ends up being just mid because Tommy Shaw was able to partially salvage it with his electric guitar work, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse.\u201cQueen Of Spades\u201d: It\u2019s tracks like this one that remind me why I\u2019m a fan of Styx. This song is amazing! Styx is definitely going on a hot streak right now, as \u201cBlue Collar Man (Long Nights)\u201d was epic and the first 10 on the album, and this song is equally epic but in its own unique way. The song starts off slow with a keyboard melody from J.Y. that sounds like a synthesized acoustic guitar (it\u2019s an excellent way to give the illusion of an acoustic guitar, as this melody sounds like Led Zeppelin\u2019s acoustic intro to \u201cStairway To Heaven\u201d if it was on a synthesizer) and the spacey, airy, psychedelic synth chords behind the melody are brilliantly executed. This keyboard instrumental sounds a lot like Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway To Heaven,\u201d as I mentioned already, and Dennis DeYoung does a great job on this instrumental with lyrics and vocals. On these verses, he sings in a soothing and mellow voice similar to the vocals on \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d from The Grand Illusion, and about a relationship that seems great, but it\u2019s smoke and mirrors. After these first two verses, Tommy Shaw comes in hard on the electric guitar alongside John Panozzo on the drums, and he does his best electric guitar work so far on the album. The riffs on the verses and chorus are gold, and his electric guitar solo kicks serious butt. It\u2019s amazing. The verses and chorus from Dennis DeYoung show what a talented vocalist he is, as he completely switches up his flow and delivery from the first two verses into an energetic and anthemic style that gives this song a sense of triumph and grandiosity. The lyrics also intensify, as Dennis DeYoung goes from talking about issues in a relationship to calling his ex-girlfriend \u201cthe queen of spades\u201d and calling her love a \u201cblack widow\u2019s curse.\u201d It\u2019s an amazing song and an epic follow-up to \u201cBlue Collar Man (Long Nights)\u201d and precursor to \u201cRenegade.\u201d\u201cPieces Of Eight\u201d: Definitely a better title track than \u201cThe Grand Illusion\u201d on The Grand Illusion. This song could\u2019ve very easily been the intro to this album, but it works really well as the outro as well. The electric guitar work from Tommy Shaw on this track is outstanding, as his guitar solo is epic and the riffs he gives on the choruses are great as well. Tommy Shaw continues his streak of epic guitar parts that he\u2019s had for the past four tracks on the album, and with this song, he gives riffs that perfectly embody Styx\u2019s AOR meets art rock sound, as they keep the track grounded while Dennis DeYoung tries to attack conceptual lyrics with somewhat over-the-top and gaudy vocals on the chorus. The song starts out slow, with a minimalist piano melody from J.Y. that doesn\u2019t allow him to do anything crazy and screw up the track, which is very good, and Dennis DeYoung\u2019s first two verses are pretty conceptual and not very grounded. The points I\u2019m taking off on this song mostly come from the lyrics and vocal delivery on these first two verses by Dennis DeYoung. The song\u2019s true subject matter and driving force isn\u2019t revealed until John Panozzo introduces the AOR / hard rock part of the song with a great drumbeat that allows Dennis DeYoung to launch into a chorus about how money (described as the \u201cpieces of eight\u201d on this song) is something that everyone chases after, thinking it will mean their happiness, but in reality, it leaves them empty. It\u2019s a bit gaudy and overblown, but Styx does a great job taking those symphonic and orchestral elements and using them to their advantage.A welcome shift in sound and genre from Styx' previous 1977 The Grand Illusion, but an album that still stays true to their sound. Just like The Grand Illusion, this song had three perfect 10s, and two of them are some of Styx\u2019s most popular songs \u201cRenegade\u201d & \u201cBlue Collar Man (Long Nights).\u201d It\u2019s interesting because each 10 on this album parallels to another 10 on the previous album. \u201cRenegade\u201d and \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d are vastly different songs, as \u201cRenegade\u201d is a hard rock banger all the way through that\u2019s a get-up-and-go anthem and \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d starts as a mellow ballad before transitioning into a hard rock banger then a synth rock song, but they were both the smash hits that took over the radio and defined the AOR genre. \u201cBlue Collar Man (Long Nights)\u201d and \u201cMan In The Wilderness\u201d are both hard jams about lack of security and downtrodden people who are down on their luck but keep pushing on. Finally, \u201cQueen Of Spades\u201d and \u201cMiss America\u201d are the progressive rock influenced songs that are harder in their sound and Styx mixing their AOR sound with prog rock and art rock styles. Those three tracks definitely defined both albums, but unlike The Grand Illusion, this album doesn\u2019t fall off as much after those three. \u201cPieces Of Eight\u201d is an excellent and strong outro track that\u2019s definitive of Styx\u2019s sound and shows them going in a more hard rock direction rather than an art rock direction, and \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d is a very good intro track where Chuck & John Panozzo are given chances to shine on the bass guitar and drums in ways they weren\u2019t before. This album shows J.Y. cutting back on the \u201cgoofy aah\u201d synth stuff (although it is still present from time to time) and Tommy Shaw getting more of a chance to prove his skills as a guitarist. Definitely a step in the right direction for Styx.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released July 7, 1977Genres: AOR, Classic Rock, Art Rock, Avant-Garde & ExperimentalTracks:The Grand Illusion \u2013 8.5Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man) \u2013 7.4Superstars \u2013 6.4Come Sail Away \u2013 10Miss America \u2013 10Man In The Wilderness \u2013 10Castle Walls \u2013 7.2The Grand Finale \u2013 7Simon\u2019s Notes: \u201cThe Grand Illusion\u201d: Off to a pretty good start with this intro track. Styx has always been a driving force in AOR since the beginning of the genre in the early 70\u2019s, but they\u2019re most well-known for their hit songs from the late 70\u2019s through the early 80\u2019s. Styx has always pushed the envelope when it comes to a cheesy, corny, and campy element in their style of AOR music, but they make it work by being a really good band and very talented musicians. That paradigm is exemplified pretty well with this intro track. Although this intro doesn\u2019t do much to showcase Styx\u2019s style of music or introduce them as musicians and people, it does showcase their ability to blend a corny and campy orchestral element with hard and epic AOR music. The keyboard melody from J.Y. is \u201ccircus-y,\u201d corny, campy, and cheesy, but the electric guitar riffs from Tommy Shaw cut through that cheesy and cringy element quite well. The lyrics and vocals from Dennis DeYoung are pretty perfect for a song like this one, as his vocals sound like a pop singer and a rock singer simultaneously, as he has a commanding and dominant voice that easily takes command of the track. His lyrics have a great message, which is that people should stop envying what their friends and neighbors have and value what they have, and his vocal delivery and flows on the chorus and verses are very good. The two electric guitar solos from Tommy Shaw are amazing and completely rip through the cringe factor of this track, and they serve as a blatant reminder that this song is hard rock, whether people want to admit it or not. The drums from John Panozzo are also pretty cheesy, campy, and corny on this song, as they have a military-style pattern that contributes to the \u201ccircus-y\u201d sound provided by the keyboard melody. This song has some pretty cringy elements and takes some major risks, but thanks to Dennis DeYoung with lyrics and vocals and Tommy Shaw on guitar, this song is pretty good.\u201cFooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)\u201d: The keyboard intro from J.Y. is cringy, campy, \u201ccircus-y,\u201d and the ultimate \u201cgoofy aah\u201d intro to any song. However, after that 1 minute intro from J.Y. on the keyboard, which is pretty cringy and is another prime example of Styx pushing the envelope with the cheesy factor they put in their music, the song launches into a less grating keyboard melody accompanied by John Panozzo on drums where he has a regular and rock-style drum pattern. Dennis DeYoung takes it from there with a pretty great vocal and lyrical performance that shows off his evocative and commanding voice alongside uplifting lyrics that caution young people to examine their lives and look to their futures. Unfortunately, after some good vocals and good lyrics, J.Y. returns with another cringy synth solo which has all of the same bad elements of the intro, but their amplified and more audacious with pushing the envelope. That isn\u2019t the end of the synths, though, as J.Y. comes back for a second synth solo later (although it\u2019s preceded by a pretty great bassline from Chuck Panozzo) and a synth outro which really pumps up the \u201cgoofy aah\u201d element and distracts from what would\u2019ve otherwise been a pretty good song with good vocals and lyrics from Dennis DeYoung. If only Tommy Shaw was on this track to cut through the cheesiness with his guitar.\u201cSuperstars\u201d: The same cringy keyboard from the last song courtesy of J.Y. opens this song, and while it\u2019s nowhere near as grating as it was on the last song, it\u2019s still present and it still serves as a bad melody for this track. The bassline from Chuck Panozzo is relatively good, but it\u2019s pretty subdued and only serves to cut through a little bit of the cheesiness presented by J.Y.\u2019s bad synth melody. The vocals from Dennis DeYoung on this track are not good, as he oversings way too much on this song and tries too hard to sound like an opera singer. The chorus is probably the best part of the song because of vocals, but the lyrics on this track are not good and indicative of formulaic and generic AOR. The guitar solo from Tommy Shaw was good, but it didn\u2019t blow me away or warrant a massive score boost. The guitar solo is pretty much ruined by what comes after it anyway, though, as it\u2019s followed by a ridiculous and cringy spoken word verse from Dennis DeYoung where he completely cringes it up by talking in a weird voice that almost sounds like Vincent Price (the guy from the outro on Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller (feat. Vincent Price)\u201d), and his lyrics only get worse on that part. This song takes the worst parts of the last song and combines them with a new valet of cringy, cheesy, corny, and campy elements.\u201cCome Sail Away\u201d: J.Y. redeems himself massively with the beautiful piano melody that opens this song and provides a brilliantly awesome base melody for the first part of this song before it transforms into a hard rock song. The piano melody combines brilliantly with synth chords on Dennis DeYoung\u2019s first and second verses, and it\u2019s an absolutely beautiful combination. If J.Y. can make a keyboard instrumental this good, why hasn\u2019t he been doing that for the entire album? The subtle drumming from John Panozzo on the first part of the song is also amazing and serves as a perfect complement to the piano and synth instrumental. Dennis DeYoung\u2019s metaphorical lyrics about sailing referring to life and setting off on new paths are great, and his vocals sound the best they\u2019ve sounded on the whole album on this part. When the song goes to its second part and transitions into a hard rock song, John Panozzo brilliantly picks up the pace with his drums, Tommy Shaw comes in great with some hard guitar riffs, and Dennis DeYoung\u2019s vocals turn from soft and smooth to evocative and anthemic, which is an awesome juxtaposition to the slow and mellow first part. This part is great, and what comes after it is amazing as well. The synth solo from J.Y. right after the hard rock verse from Dennis DeYoung is incredible, and likely one of my favorite synth solos of all time. I can\u2019t believe this dude, who just made some of the most \u201cgoofy aah\u201d synth instrumentals of all time, is now coming in with an absolute banger of a solo on this track. I\u2019m glad he did, but come on, J.Y., show some consistency. The track finishes out beautifully with another epic hard rock verse and chorus from Dennis DeYoung, accompanied by Tommy Shaw\u2019s amazing guitar riffs and John Panozzo\u2019s great drumming. A quintessential Styx song, a benchmark AOR song, and just an all-around great track.\u201cMiss America\u201d: Opens with another great synth melody from J.Y., then turns into an equally great electric guitar melody from Tommy Shaw. The electric guitar on this track is low, heavy, and indicative of a harder sound, while the bass guitar from Chuck Panozzo perfectly complements it and helps it achieve that low and heavy sound. Dennis DeYoung adopts a deeper vocal delivery for this track; he pitches his voice down one octave for a deeper and heavier hard rock sound, and he sounds quite good in the lower octave. The vocals on this song are good and the lyrics are very good, as Dennis DeYoung tells the story of the winner of the Miss America pageant who is placed under extreme scrutiny within the public eye and often crumbles with the pressures of newfound fame. This song is definitely not what I would\u2019ve expected from Styx, especially after the last track, but Tommy Shaw is just as poised and ready-to-go with his guitar playing on this track as he was on the previous one, and he\u2019s given more of a chance to shine on this song with a full guitar solo. J.Y. is also given a synth solo on this track as well. This song is like a harder, heavier, and more metal counterpart to \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d with a subject matter that\u2019s more serious and Dennis DeYoung vocals that are deeper. I\u2019m a big fan of this sound from Styx.\u201cMan In The Wilderness\u201d: Woah! So many cool elements in one song; it\u2019s hard to determine what to talk about first. The melody, which is built on a heavy, dense electric guitar riff combined with the bass guitar courtesy of Tommy Shaw and Chuck Panozzo, is absolutely fire, and the sparse yet powerful drumming form John Panozzo sets up the song brilliantly. The verses from Dennis DeYoung are fire, as he has great vocals and great lyrics on this track that match or surpass his performance on \u201cCome Sail Away.\u201d The chorus from Dennis DeYoung is also fire, as it reminds me of contemporary progressive rock bands and what they were doing at this time, both in vocal sound and in subject matter. The guitar solo from Tommy Shaw absolutely rips, as he channels his inner Jimi Hendrix for that solo and busts out what is probably the best guitar solo on this album so far. This track draws heavy influence from The Jimi Hendrix Experience\u2019s \u201c1983\u2026 (A Merman I Should Turn To Be),\u201d as it even features a subtle flute melody like that track does, but this song is a much abridged version of that epic jam session from Electric Ladyland. The track takes influence from Jimi Hendrix-era psychedelia, progressive rock, and AOR, and Tommy Shaw, Chuck Panozzo, John Panozzo, and Dennis DeYoung handle the wide variety of influences brilliantly. What an epic and amazing song.\u201cCastle Walls\u201d: Bass intro from Chuck Panozzo is absolutely awesome, especially when paired with the orchestral-sounding and cool synth organ from J.Y.. The foreboding atmosphere this intro creates is very good, but it\u2019s unfortunately ruined when Dennis DeYoung comes in with terrible vocals on the verse. He sounds like a woman trying to use a \u201ccreepy voice\u201d to tell a story, and the lyrics on this song are pretty cringe, as they sound like Dennis DeYoung stole them from a Shakespearean play. The vocals suck and the lyrics suck on this track, and though the chorus has a pretty awesome guitar riff from Tommy Shaw on it, it\u2019s not good because Dennis DeYoung does a terrible job with vocals. After a disjointed and misguided synth solo from J.Y. that had hits and misses, Tommy Shaw comes in with the help of Chuck Panozzo on bass and plays a few riffs before launching into another epic guitar solo. Unfortunately, after that solo is over, Dennis DeYoung comes back in with another bad chorus to finish out the song. While Chuck Panozzo, J.Y., and Tommy Shaw do their best to make it sound good, they ultimately can\u2019t do much to salvage Dennis DeYoung\u2019s vocals. Mid song.\u201cThe Grand Finale\u201d: Gaudy, overblown, grandiose, and theatrical. Styx tried way too hard to make a closer that wrapped up this album\u2019s diverse and unique sounds in one song. This track is disjointed, all-over-the-place, misguided, and simply can\u2019t fit the ideas of seven vastly different tracks into its short length of 1 minute and 57 seconds. Dennis DeYoung recycles some lyrics from \u201cThe Grand Illusion\u201d and \u201cCome Sail Away,\u201d and neither of the lyrical interpolations do the original songs justice. This song is supposed to be a summary and culmination of everything that happened on this album, but it ends up sounding like someone tried way too hard to get all of the songs on this album into one track, but somehow only found the mid elements of each song and combined those. Not a fitting outro for this album.Styx has always been a band that\u2019s been easy to make fun of by rock critics, rock fans, and all forms of pop culture. Jokes about Styx have been included in the TV show That 70\u2019s Show, where Eric Forman is mocked by his friends for being a die-hard Styx fan, and in the Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy, where the two main characters are Styx fans and everyone makes fun of them for it. Styx is certainly a band that\u2019s not for everyone: Their experimental sound is like soft-serve progressive rock mixed with radio-friendly AOR. They often include gaudy, grandiose, theatrical, and overblown arrangements in their music, most featuring orchestral-sounding instruments and vocals from Dennis DeYoung that can sound operatic at times. On this album, Styx experiments quite a bit with new styles and sounds, but they hit the nail on the head multiple times. \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d is an amazing and epic song that brings out the best in Styx, being a hard rock song, a piano ballad, and a synth rock song all at the same time; \u201cMiss America\u201d is a great track that shows Styx can do amazing things as a hard rock band despite their often cheesy and corny sound, as this track drops all of the campy and cringy synths from J.Y. that populated the first three tracks and just rocks; and \u201cMan In The Wilderness\u201d is a blissful yet hard combination of AOR, progressive rock, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience\u2019s sound of proto-prog meets psychedelia. It\u2019s a very interesting combination, no doubt about that, but it allows Tommy Shaw to go absolutely HAM on the electric guitar while Dennis DeYoung belts out amazing lyrics that sound like they could be on an album by a progressive rock band. Unfortunately, although this album has some major highlights, there are some definite L\u2019s on here as well. \u201cSuperheroes\u201d & \u201cCastle Walls\u201d are perhaps the two times where Styx goes furthest off the rails and pushes too far into the realms of \u201cgoofy aah\u201d synth and weird medieval-sounding orchestral music. Styx can have some cheesy, cringy, and campy music that can put them in the category of the \u201cHannah Montana of rock bands,\u201d there\u2019s no doubt about that, but they\u2019re also amazing musicians who can really go hard and make great music if they drop the cringe factor. This album is a mixed bag, but the few hits that are on here are peak and show Styx\u2019s great potential.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released January 6, 1976Genres: AOR, Classic Rock, Pop Rock, Live MusicTracks:Something\u2019s Happening (Live) \u2013 7.4Doobie Wah (Live) \u2013 8.3Show Me The Way (Live) \u2013 9.6It\u2019s A Plain Shame (Live) \u2013 9All I Want To Be (Is By Your Side) (Live) \u2013 10Wind Of Change (Live) \u2013 7.2Baby, I Love Your Way (Live) \u2013 10I Wanna Go To The Sun (Live) \u2013 7.6(I\u2019ll Give You) Money (Live) \u2013 10Shine On (Live) \u2013 10Jumping Jack Flash (Live) \u2013 8.5Lines On My Face (Live) \u2013 10Do You Feel Like We Do (Live) \u2013 10[Instrumental track \u201cPenny For Your Thoughts (Live)\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cSomething\u2019s Happening (Live)\u201d: This song is painstakingly and glaringly mid. It\u2019s a very stereotypical track and is a generic, formulaic, and basic 70\u2019s AOR (adult-oriented rock) song that doesn\u2019t have much substance. The lyrics and vocals from Peter Frampton are mid at best, and while his guitar solos are both cool and reminiscent of better AOR artists like Boston, Journey, REO Speedwagon, and Styx, the drums and bass on this track are muddied because of poor post-production (seeing as this project is a live album). After having heard Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox, and Buddy Miles\u2019 masterpiece live album Band Of Gypsys, my expectations have been raised for how live albums should sound, and this song isn\u2019t meeting them. This song is too long, too generic, and too formulaic, which makes it mid.\u201cDoobie Wah (Live)\u201d: The post-production on this song is much better than it was on the intro track, as the drums and bass are both clear and clean on this track, and they make large contributions to the song\u2019s overall sound. Based on what I\u2019ve heard from him so far, Peter Frampton is not a very good vocalist. He sounds sort of like a higher-pitched version of Bruce Springsteen mixed with a higher-pitched version of the Doobie Brothers (no pun intended based on the song title), and his vocals are probably a C or C- grade if I had to assign one. The lyrics and vocals on this song are mid, but the instrumentation is really strong. The two guitar solos from Peter Frampton are really good, the bassline is sleek, polished, and very well-executed, and the drums keep the pace of the track perfectly. There were times on here when I wanted Peter Frampton to shut up so he could just jam on the guitar with the bassist and drummer because the song\u2019s strongest parts were its instrumental sections. This song is good, but Peter Frampton should definitely pick it up when it comes to vocals and lyrics.\u201cShow Me The Way (Live)\u201d: This track marks the first time the talkbox was ever used on a mainstream album. Quite a landmark event for music. Although there were parts of the previous track \u201cDoobie Wah (Live)\u201d that I enjoyed, this song is the first time this album has lived up to its name and Peter Frampton has truly come alive. The vocals and lyrics on this song are great; instead of sounding like generic, basic, and formulaic AOR, Peter Frampton sounds like the best aspects of the genre with lush, energetic, and evocative vocals, as well as uplifting and positive lyrics that show Peter Frampton wanting to give himself to a girl romantically and asking her to \u201cshow [him] the way, every day.\u201d It sounds like the problems with post-production are a thing of the past, as this song and the previous one have both had a crisp and clear sound. The bassline on this track is excellent, the drum pattern is great and helps to keep Peter Frampton\u2019s verses on track and focused, but the one part of the track I dislike is its most innovative part. The talkbox on this track doesn\u2019t sound good at all. I realize I\u2019m listening to this song with today\u2019s standards of music, as the talkbox has now been around for almost 50 years and has been perfected and refined over time and it was being used for the first time ever on this album, but the talkbox on here sounds like the voice of one of the reindeer from the Tim Allen Santa Clause movies. The guitar solos are coated in the talkbox, so Peter Frampton\u2019s guitar acumen can\u2019t shine through, as the talkbox makes them sound muddied and off-putting. Regardless of the talkbox, this song is great, but I wish the talkbox sounded better on here since it was such an innovative song.\u201cIt\u2019s A Plain Shame (Live)\u201d: I\u2019m sad to say that lyrics are taking a backseat once again on this song. After a rocky start to this album, Peter Frampton is starting to \u201ccome alive\u201d as a vocalist, as I\u2019m upgrading his vocal grade from a C- or a C to a B or a B+; he\u2019s definitely finding his vocal persona and getting more comfortable as the album goes on. The guitar melody and solos are great on this song; Peter Frampton is an excellent guitarist whose playing style embodies the hard but accessible style that makes guitar on AOR songs so awesome, and the bass guitar is a great companion for it. Drums are present on this song, but they\u2019re not as important as they\u2019ve been on past tracks; it\u2019s definitely the bass and Peter Frampton on the guitar that take center stage. Now, as for the lyrics, they\u2019re the only part of the song that sucks. Most of the lyrics are mid because of cringiness and corniness, but there\u2019s one line in particular, where Peter Frampton says \u201cI\u2019d like to get arrested, I\u2019d rather be molested, I don\u2019t care how old you are,\u201d that\u2019s potentially one of the most out-of-pocket and heinous lines I\u2019ve ever heard on any song. Lyrics undoubtedly took a backseat on this track, and it\u2019s made overly apparent by that ridiculously bad line. Very good song overall, but garbage lyrics.\u201cAll I Want To Be (Is By Your Side) (Live)\u201d: Again, Peter Frampton is continuing to impress me with his vocal talents after getting off to a rough start on this album. The vocals on this song are amazing, and the lyrics are great as well. Peter Frampton, over an instrumental that\u2019s much more minimalist and features a strumming, low-pitched, acoustic guitar melody, belts out high notes like they\u2019re nothing and sings in a smooth and laid-back voice in the same lines. The lyrics, which are a touching and emotional song about wanting to be with a girl no matter what happens, are great and help make up for the garbage that was on the last song. The crowd goes wild for this song, and it\u2019s not hard to see why with how great it is. Peter Frampton was the star of the show vocally, lyrically, and with his guitar on this song, and there wasn\u2019t much space for the bass and the drums to do anything because Peter Frampton masterfully overtook this track and rocked it.\u201cWind Of Change (Live)\u201d: I was hoping this song would be related to the song \u201cWind Of Change\u201d by Scorpions, but I was disappointed, as this track has no connection whatsoever to that one and it\u2019s mid. The acoustic guitar instrumental is mid at best, as Peter Frampton couldn\u2019t make lightning strike twice and have back-to-back good acoustic guitar tracks. The melody is basic, contrived, and not indicative of Peter Frampton\u2019s skill, and the lyrics are mid as well. They\u2019re not egregious or bad like they\u2019ve been on some of this album\u2019s other tracks; they\u2019re just forgettable and overall not good. The vocals are average, and Peter Frampton\u2019s one-man-show technique on this song doesn\u2019t pay off nearly as well as it did on the previous track.\u201cBaby, I Love Your Way (Live)\u201d: The quintessential Peter Frampton song. This song\u2019s acoustic guitar melody pairs brilliantly with its smooth, laid-back, low-key, and lo-fi drum pattern and the Moog synthesizer chords, as well as the Moog synthesizer solo, which takes the place of a guitar solo on this track and honestly works better for the sound of the song than a guitar solo would. The vocals from Peter Frampton on this song are probably the best I\u2019ve heard from him so far on the album, and he\u2019s in his element singing the smooth, sultry, and mellow verses and chorus on this track. The verses detail a tranquil setting, while the chorus sees Peter Frampton expressing his love for everything his girl does in a smooth and laid-back form. It\u2019s an amazing track that definitely shows why Peter Frampton should be a standout in 70\u2019s rock and the genre of AOR. Not many AOR bands could make a smooth, polished, and refined track that\u2019s almost elegant pop, but Peter Frampton obviously could and did with this song.\u201cI Wanna Go To The Sun (Live)\u201d: The guitar solos on this track are amazing! Peter Frampton shows how awesome of a guitarist he is on this track more so than any other I\u2019ve heard so far on this album with the epic solos that he has. These solos left me speechless and got me thinking about putting Peter Frampton up there with the all-time GOAT guitarists like Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Eddie Hazel, and Eddie Van Halen. However, everything else about this track doesn\u2019t dazzle or inspire the same way those solos do. The lyrics and vocals on this track are okay at best (pretty mid, honestly); the piano melody is weak, basic, and formulaic; the drums are generic and watered-down; and the electric guitar on the parts that aren\u2019t the solos is good, but nothing incredibly special. This song did not need to be 7 minutes and 12 seconds, though, as the only good parts of the track are the two guitar solos, and the first guitar solo didn\u2019t come until about 4 minutes and 40 seconds into the track. I was not a fan of the constant repetition of the chorus, and Peter Frampton sounded like he was phoning in the vocals to buy time until the next solo. The guitar solos were spectacular, but nothing else about the track was remotely close to being as good.\u201c(I\u2019ll Give You) Money\u201d: Wow. This song is definitely a shift in the style and tone that Peter Frampton has had so far on this album, but it\u2019s definitely a welcome shift, as this song sounds like something Led Zeppelin would make, as it has a hard, thumping, and driving drum pattern with prominent kicks and cymbal crashes, a hard, wailing, gritty, and grainy electric guitar melody and multiple epic solos that sound like something Led Zeppelin\u2019s Jimmy Page would do, and a bassline that matches the grittiness and hard rock sound of the drums and electric guitar. The lyrics on this song show Peter Frampton in love with a girl and ready to devote everything he has to her, including the titular item of money, and this kind of subject is when Peter Frampton is at his best vocally and lyrically. Peter Frampton lowers his pitch slightly on his vocals for this track to match its hard rock sound, and it\u2019s an amazing touch, as it adds so much more to the track. I could easily see this song having been made by Led Zeppelin or another contemporary 70\u2019s hard rock band. Peter Frampton is continuing to impress me with his versatility, his guitar playing, and his ability to blend his own AOR style with different other styles of pop and rock. He\u2019s a truly multi-talented artist. Amazing song.\u201cShine On (Live)\u201d: Peter Frampton is going on a run right now in terms of great songs. This song is a banger! The electric guitar melody from Peter Frampton is shredding, hard yet accessible, classic AOR, while the organ chords in the background provide an awesome progression and a lush sound to the instrumental. The drums are solid on this track; cymbal crashes are brilliantly executed while regular drums keep the melody and the flows on Peter Frampton\u2019s verses in check. Great production, and Peter Frampton is awesome on vocals. The lyrics on the verses are a bit formulaic and generic and indicative of the 70\u2019s AOR sound, but Peter Framtpon\u2019s great vocal delivery and strong flows distract from the fact that the lyrics aren\u2019t the strongest. The chorus is also amazingly well-done, as Peter Frampton\u2019s evocative vocals correspond brilliantly with his growling and low-pitched electric guitar riffs. Another epic song.\u201cJumping Jack Flash (Live)\u201d: A cover of \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u201d by The Rolling Stones, which was released in 1968. Since I\u2019ve heard the original song, I can confidently say that Peter Frampton didn\u2019t do it justice with this cover. His flows on the verses are terrible, and they turn the lyrics of the original \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash,\u201d which tell a story that\u2019s similar to The Jimi Hendrix Experience\u2019s \u201cVoodoo Child (Slight Return),\u201d into pure and complete nonsense. The way Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones flows on those verses on the original makes the song sound like a cohesive story, but the way Peter Frampton flows on this track doesn\u2019t convey the same thing. The lyrics just sound like nonsense with Peter Frampton\u2019s bad flows on the verses and chorus. I\u2019m not a huge fan of his vocals on this song either. However, this song is still good because the instrumental parts are absolutely amazing. Peter Frampton takes the original riff from The Rolling Stones, which was a bluesy and hard rock guitar riff, and changes it up to a more AOR and polished riff that honestly sounds a bit better than The Rolling Stones\u2019 version. The organ chords are awesome on the instrumental, as they add a lot of structure to the track, the bassline is paired amazingly with the electric guitar parts, and the electric guitar solos are fire. They completely bring the house down for this track, as they almost completely erase the fact that this cover doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the original song and doesn\u2019t work as a cover. If Peter Frampton had just borrowed the riff and gone with new lyrics, this song would\u2019ve been a lot better, but as a cover, it doesn\u2019t really work.\u201cLines On My Face (Live)\u201d: Peter Frampton makes the guitar sing on this track, perhaps better than he does. The guitar melodies are stellar, as they sound polished, refined, and elegant, especially paired with the subtle hi-hat based drum pattern with minimal kicks, and the guitar solos are absolutely excellent. There are three guitar solos on here, and each of them sound uniquely amazing, as the guitar sounds different every time. Not many guitarists can switch up styles mid track, especially on a live stage and twice in one track. This song shows true mastery of the guitar by Peter Frampton, and though his vocals and lyrics (and pretty much everything else except the organ flourishes, which are equally as epic as the guitar solos) take a backseat on this one, they\u2019re still very good and still pull their weight very well on the song. This track starts out a bit slow, but the epic crescendos of the guitar solos and cool riffs on the choruses (in addition to the amazing organ chords on the choruses) make up for the slow start and more than compensate. Another track that makes me consider putting Peter Frampton within my top 5 all-time GOAT guitarists list. Absolutely amazing.\u201cDo You Feel Like We Do (Live)\u201d: 1. Jimi Hendrix; 2. David Gilmour; 3. Eddie Hazel; 4. Eddie Van Halen; and after this track, 5. Peter Frampton. It\u2019s absolutely amazing how this album started with a song I wasn\u2019t sure about and me calling Peter Frampton a typical AOR guitarist with little to no nuance and saying he was a C- to C grade vocalist and ended with me saying that Peter Frampton is a top 5 all-time GOAT guitarist. The electric guitar work on this song, and pretty much throughout this album, is absolutely GOATed. This song is pretty much the culmination of everything Peter Frampton has done so far on this album. He\u2019s already had amazingly awesome guitar work throughout this album, but it all culminated for this amazing track that actually sounds like it would fit right in on Pink Floyd\u2019s Wish You Were Here or The Jimi Hendrix Experience\u2019s Electric Ladyland. The electric guitar solos are on point, the organ solo is awesome, the melodies from both the organ and the electric guitar are incredible, and Peter Frampton\u2019s vocals and lyrics are very good as well. I haven\u2019t even mentioned what this song is known for: The legendary talkbox outro where Peter Frampton essentially recreates his amazing guitar solo with his voice in talkbox format. Unlike \u201cShow Me The Way (Live),\u201d the talkbox on this song sounds absolutely incredible and amazingly awesome. The minimalist organ melody that goes on while Peter Frampton is wailing on the talkbox is amazing, and it essentially gives him a playground to do whatever he wants. The crowd was getting hype for it, and rightfully so. Totally awesome way to end this album, as this song not only used the talkbox for the first time and introduced it to modern music, but also earned Peter Frampton a spot in my top 5 all-time GOAT guitarists list.It\u2019s amazing how much this album grew on me as I was listening to it. I went into this album knowing next to nothing about Peter Frampton. Before this album was requested, I was told it was one of the most popular vinyls and most popular albums in the 70\u2019s, which I was shocked to hear since I\u2019d never heard of Peter Frampton or this album, which has been lauded as the most popular and best live album of all time. I think the title of best live album will forever be held by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox & Buddy Miles and their Band Of Gypsys live album in 1970, but this album is certainly excellent, especially for a live album. As I was saying earlier, this album grew on me tremendously as I was listening to it. After the first two tracks \u201cSomething\u2019s Happening (Live)\u201d & \u201cDoobie Wah (Live),\u201d I was less than impressed with Peter Frampton. The latter was a good song, but only because of the excellent electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum work on it. I was ready to write him off as a one-trick AOR guitarist and a C to C- grade vocalist, and I was ready to dismiss this album entirely. However, Peter Frampton roped me in with the talkbox-utilizing (he was the first artist ever to use a talkbox on a mainstream album) \u201cShow Me The Way (Live),\u201d where the talkbox was a bit crude, but everything else was fire. Excluding two more mid tracks, Peter Frampton went on an absolute hot streak for the rest of the album where his electric guitar work was incredible, the backing band supported him brilliantly, and he continued to show me just how amazing of a guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter he is. His songwriting did leave a bit to be desired at times, as lyrics were definitely the weakest part of this album, but everything else was pretty epic for the most part. By about the middle of the album, I was ready to consider Peter Frampton for being a part of my top 5 all-time GOAT guitarists, and after the album\u2019s 14-minute long closer \u201cDo You Feel Like We Do (Live),\u201d he firmly cemented himself and snagged a spot on that list. This album might\u2019ve gotten off to a rocky start, and it may not be perfect, but it is very good, and Peter Frampton is the furthest thing from a C- grade vocalist or a one-trick pony guitarist.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released May 24, 1997Genres: GrungeTracks:Find Myself \u2013 0.3Afraid \u2013 1.2Flush \u2013 2.6Generation Swine \u2013 0.1Confessions \u2013 0.1Beauty \u2013 0.1Glitter \u2013 0.1Anybody Out There? \u2013 0.1Let Us Prey \u2013 0.1Rocketship \u2013 1.8A Rat Like Me \u2013 0.1Shout At The Devil \u201897 \u2013 1.2Brandon \u2013 0.1Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cFind Myself\u201d: Well, this song is completely terrible. We are off to an abysmal start for this album. The last M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album I reviewed, Dr. Feelgood, was very disappointing because M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce only put out two good songs on that ten-track album, but this intro track signals that this album is gonna be a whole new level of terrible. There\u2019s only one positive for this track: The guitar melody from Mick Mars. Mick Mars' heavy, dense, growling, and industrial-style guitar playing on this song is pretty good, and since M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was obviously going for a grunge rock sound with this song, the melody and playing style work pretty well for grunge. However, everything else about this song is complete and irredeemable garbage. The verses from bassist Nikki Sixx have bad vocals, horrendously awful lyrics, and a flow that\u2019s more speaking than singing. The chorus from Vince Neil is almost worse than the verses, as his vocals sound horrible, and he\u2019s essentially just screaming and cursing excessively without saying anything at all. He uses the F-word about 4 times on each chorus, but he\u2019s really not saying anything at all, just telling everyone what a \u201cbada$$ motherf***er\u201d he is (with this song, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence to back up that claim). This song is just an awful attempt at grunge by a glam metal band well past their prime.\u201cAfraid\u201d: M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce is trying so hard on this track to imitate popular grunge bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains, but all they\u2019re really doing with this song is sounding like a bargain-brand, low-rent version of all of those bands while tarnishing their legacy and degrading themselves. The vocals from Vince Neil on this track are atrociously bad, as he\u2019s trying to imitate the vocal delivery of Kurt Cobain from Nirvana and Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam, but he\u2019s just proving how terrible of a vocalist he is in the process. His vocals are mixed terribly, and it sounds like a prismizer effect has been applied to his vocals on the verses, but it hasn\u2019t, it\u2019s just his voice being so awful that it clashes with the bad mixing. The drums from Tommy Lee are tepid, trite, and contrived; the bass from Nikki Sixx is listless, repetitive, and half-baked; and yet again, Mick Mars is the best part of the song with his guitar riffs and melody, but even though his guitar is the best part of this song, it\u2019s a rip-off of popular grunge bands and popular grunge guitar playing styles. It\u2019s unoriginal, but it\u2019s done moderately well by Mick Mars. Another awful track that sounds like M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce had no idea what they were doing.\u201cFlush\u201d: This song is such a blatant rip-off of \u201cPlush\u201d by Stone Temple Pilots that it\u2019s not even funny. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce isn\u2019t even trying to hide the fact that this song is a complete rip-off, as they changed literally one letter in the title from \u201cPlush\u201d by Stone Temple Pilots to \u201cFlush.\u201d Although this song is a low-rent, bargain-brand, rip-off of Stone Temple Pilots that also manages to sound like the bargain-brand version of Soundgarden and Alice In Chains as well, it sounds better than anything else on the album so far. Yes, Vince Neil\u2019s vocals are horrible, Tommy Lee\u2019s drums are uninspired, and the lyrics completely suck and have no meaning, but Mick Mars on guitar and Nikki Sixx on bass aren\u2019t completely terrible on this track. They do a pretty convincing job creating a growling, low-pitched, grainy, and menacing grunge rock instrumental with a deep sounding, heavy guitar melody and a bassline that\u2019s closely paired with that guitar melody and very grainy. The melody is actually pretty good, but I suppose that\u2019s because it was stolen directly from the Stone Temple Pilots song this track blatantly rips off. This song is another example of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce being completely devoid of creativity and being forced to rip off other bands to stay relevant.\u201cGlitter\u201d: A fusion or synthpop and grunge from a glam metal band way past its prime? Well, that\u2019s something I never expected and never thought I\u2019d ever have to hear, but now I\u2019ve heard it, and it\u2019s absolutely awful. Vince Neil actually sounds like Corey Feldman with vocals and lyrics on this track (it\u2019s not even an exaggeration, his vocals are actually that bad on this song), and although the synth chords and airy synth melody is average on this song, it\u2019s out-of-place and weird on a track that also has a grimy, gritty, grunge bassline from Nikki Sixx and vocals and lyrics that remind me of Corey Feldman and some of the worst music I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. This song just doesn\u2019t work at all and it clearly shows that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce has no idea what they\u2019re doing on this album anymore.\u201cLet Us Prey\u201d: This track might\u2019ve started out promising with that gritty, grainy, loud, and raucous guitar riff from Mick Mars (I was still a bit cautious because it was pretty loud, abrasive, and in-your-face, which meant it could take over the track and become too much), but it quickly degraded into an instant skip. As soon as Vince Neil started singing on the first verse, I knew this song was terrible, as the ridiculous, stupid, cringy, misogynistic, and rapey lyrics from Dr. Feelgood that made tracks like \u201cSlice Of Your Pie,\u201d \u201cSticky Sweet,\u201d and \u201cShe Goes Down\u201d so horrifically bad returned on that verse, as Vince Neil sees a girl as his \u201cprey\u201d and talks about basically wanting to rape her on this song, and the chorus echoes that sentiment in a screamo way that begins with \u201cPlease, please, let us prey,\u201d and then Vince Neil starts screaming as the once promising guitar riff from Mick Mars degrades into raucous noise that just takes up space and offers nothing new or original to this song. Another straight up awful track to continue the streak of 0.1s.\u201cRocketship\u201d: A psychedelic infusion into this album that offers a much-needed nuance and a brief respite from the terrible grunge rock sound, but this song is the lowest of low-rent psychedelia. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce rips off Slowdive and The Jimi Hendrix Experience with this track, but turns both of those styles into a hapless, lifeless, listless, and flavorless \u201cspacey\u201d psychedelic sound, attempting shoegaze in what I\u2019m gonna call \u201cM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fcegaze.\u201d Mick Mars sounds pretty good on the acoustic guitar on this track, as he sounds like he\u2019s trying to imitate Christian Savill, the guitarist from Slowdive, on this song, but the \u201cspacey\u201d sound effects sound generic, formulaic, and the most watered-down and basic possible rip-off of \u201cMay This Be Love\u201d by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lyrics are hilariously basic and generic, as the themes of \u201cspace,\u201d \u201cfloating,\u201d and \u201ctaking off\u201d are all trite and contrived tropes in psychedelia. Better than a lot of the songs on this album, but absolutely garbage nonetheless.\u201cShout At The Devil \u201897\u201d: Absolutely ridiculous and garbage. I can\u2019t believe M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce decided to remake \u201cShout At The Devil,\u201d a commercial hit from their early 80\u2019s pop metal days, and turn it into a grunge rock meets glam metal fusion track that sounds like it was done by a bad M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce cover band rather than by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce themselves. The vocals from Vince Neil on this song are horrendous and atrociously bad, as both his vocal delivery and the vocal mixing are terrible. I can\u2019t believe how actually horrible this cover is; the only thing that makes it mildly tolerable is that it has hints of the old 80\u2019s glam metal M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce sound in Nikki Sixx\u2019s bassline and Mick Mars\u2019 guitar melody, although those are kind of poisoned by the dumb and stupid attempt at grunge fusion that this song displays.\u201cBrandon\u201d: Tommy Lee singing about his son on an instrumental that fuses gaudy and overblown orchestral instruments with grunge rock? Absolutely horrendous. This song actually sounds like \u201cMercy (feat. Brandon Howard & The Marquise Henderson and Liberated Choir)\u201d by Corey Feldman. This song sounds like what Corey Feldman listened to before making the entire Angelic 2 The Core album. Corey probably thought \u201cyeah, this song is really good, I\u2019m gonna base my entire album off what Tommy Lee sounds like on this song.\u201d This track is actually that bad. It\u2019s totally out of place on a grunge rock album from a past-their-prime glam metal band (or out of place on any album, for that matter), and the lyrics are cheesy, campy, sappy, overly sentimental, and ridiculously stupid. Especially considering the fact that Tommy Lee was going through an extremely public sex tape scandal at the time this album was being recorded, and that Pamela Anderson had divorced Tommy Lee by the time this album was finally released. What a terrible and ridiculous song. I can\u2019t believe anyone in M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce thought this track was a good idea. But, in all honesty, that can be said about this entire album.I\u2019ve been wanting to review this album ever since I learned about its existence from Hulu\u2019s fictionalized docuseries Pam & Tommy (starring Lily James & Sebastian Stan as the titular couple, the Baywatch actress and the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer), where the album was mercilessly mocked and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce found themselves kicked out of their own studio by Third Eye Blind at one point during the show. I wasn\u2019t aware M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce continued to make music into the 90\u2019s at that time, and from what was said about this album in the show, I knew I had to hear what all the mockery was about. I watched Pam & Tommy in 2021, and now, two years later in 2023, I\u2019m finally getting around to reviewing this album. This album is egregiously bad. I would put this album down with Doug Walker (The Nostalgia Critic) & Rob Scallion\u2019s Nostalgia Critic\u2019s The Wall and Corey Feldman\u2019s Angelic 2 The Core: Angelic Funkadelic / Angelic Rockadelic as one of the worst rock albums of all time. This album is the attempt of a glam metal band whose fame ran out at the end of the 80\u2019s attempting to make a comeback by making the worst grunge music imaginable. I already am not a fan of grunge, but this album seems to fuse the worst elements from popular grunge artists like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and Stone Temple Pilots with the worst elements of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s music in the 80\u2019s to make a slew of egregiously bad songs. The \u201cbest\u201d song on the album, if we can even call it that, is \u201cFlush,\u201d which is in every way it can be, a shameless rip-off of Stone Temple Pilots' \u201cPlush.\u201d M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce doesn\u2019t just make terrible grunge on this album, they also attempt what I call \u201cM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fcegaze,\u201d which is their brand of low-rent, watered-down, and half-baked psychedelia which tries its best to sound like Slowdive and the shoegaze genre, but fails in every way possible. Vocals are spread around on this album, and whether it\u2019s Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, or Tommy Lee on vocals, the vocal grade is an F. They all suck at singing on this album, and it only becomes more obvious the further I go into this album. I was a bit shocked to find that Dr. Feelgood wasn\u2019t nearly as good as I remembered it being, so I braced for impact with how bad this album would be, and even still, I was taken aback by how absolutely horrendous this album is. One of the worst albums of all time and a perfect representation of why hapless and washed-up glam metal bands should never have attempted to shift to grunge.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 1, 1989Genres: Pop Metal, Glam, RockTracks:Dr. Feelgood \u2013 10Slice Of Your Pie \u2013 3.2Rattlesnake Shake \u2013 1Kickstart My Heart \u2013 9.8Without You \u2013 7Same Ol' Situation (S.O.S.) \u2013 6.5Sticky Sweet \u2013 1.6She Goes Down \u2013 0.1Don\u2019t Go Away Mad (Just Go Away) \u2013 7.4Time For Change (feat.

(Terror \u2018N Tinseltown)\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d: This song might not be M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s first or most popular song, but it is the quintessential M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song. It is the title track and intro track for this album, which is one of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s most popular albums (if not their most popular) and is widely considered to be their magnum opus (best album) by rock and metal fans. This song is the perfect introduction to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce which introduces their musical style, the styles and talents of each individual member of the band, and the band\u2019s background and who they are. The growling, gritty, and menacing bassline from bassist Nikki Sixx opens the track and remains a consistent part throughout, then guitarist Mick Mars takes over with some powerful and amplified guitar riffs that create a gritty, punchy, and glam metal melody for this track. Lead singer Vince Neil takes it from there, and though he doesn\u2019t have the best voice traditionally, his nasally, somewhat grating, and rebellious voice is great for this kind of music. If he was a vocalist in any other band in any other genre, Vince Neil would be trash, but in pop metal / glam metal, he thrives. His voice would be too high and too grating for a metal band like Metallica; it\u2019s not smooth or polished enough for an AOR band like REO Speedwagon, Styx, or Journey; and though he\u2019d have the best chance of success in a progressive rock band like Rush, his flow is too wild and crazy to fit the prog rock structure. It\u2019s perfect for pop metal, but terrible for anything else. Drummer Tommy Lee keeps the song in line with punchy and impactful drumming throughout the song, and he accompanies the low growl of Nikki Sixx\u2019s bassline and rebellious cry of Mick Mars' guitar riffs perfectly. Mick Mars also has an amazing guitar solo on this track, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s carving out his own sound as a guitarist with this track; the solo is completely original and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever heard before. He might be taking some pointers from other metal guitarists like Slash from Guns N' Roses, but it\u2019s a unique and distinct sound crafted for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s original style. The song is about a drug dealer named Jimmy who goes by the titular alias Dr. Feelgood, and this subject matter is perfect for this band, who have witnessed these kinds of characters firsthand as a band playing small-time on the sleazy Sunset Strip of Los Angeles. The band has also had numerous experiences with hard drugs, so an opening song about a drug dealer getting busted is the perfect way to say \u201cyeah, we were on drugs before, but we\u2019ve kicked \u2018em now and we\u2019re ready to give you some good music.\u201d Interestingly enough, I know more about M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce than I do about a lot of my favorite bands and artists, as my dad is a big fan of them (I like them too, but not as much as he does), and we have seen many VH1 Behind The Music documentaries about them (along with Aerosmith & Led Zeppelin). Not to mention that I watched Pam & Tommy, the fictionalized docuseries about drummer Tommy Lee\u2019s relationship and sex tape with actress Pamela Anderson. Anyway, this song is a great way to start the album and a brilliant introduction to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\u201cSlice Of Your Pie\u201d: A horrendously garbage chorus with a cringy metaphor, two verses of Vince Neil lusting over underage girls, a third verse where Vince Neil tells a girl he\u2019s \u201cgot some sticky sweet for [her]\u201d multiple times (referring to his cum), a guitar solo from Mick Mars which absolutely sucks and sounds garbage, and finally to finish the song, an extremely misguided attempt at traditional doom metal where Nikki Sixx essentially rips off the outro to The Beatles' \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy),\u201d but makes it the bargain-brand version of that song in the process. How did we go from that amazing intro track to this piece of garbage?\u201cRattlesnake Shake\u201d: A song based on a dance with terrible production, awful vocals, ridiculous and bad drums and guitar, and lyrics that make this song sound ridiculously cringe. I don\u2019t know why any band thinks it\u2019s a good idea to make a song based on a dance, but this song has even more of a cringe factor because the dance in question is also a sex position, and lead singer Vince Neil is not only telling people listening to do the dance in question, he\u2019s also telling a woman to do a sex position with him. It\u2019s extreme cringe.\u201cKickstart My Heart\u201d: Another quintessential M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song that perfectly encapsulates the band\u2019s musical style, the band\u2019s background and where they come from, and spotlights two of the band\u2019s members: guitarist Mick Mars & drummer Tommy Lee. The production and instrumentation on this song is absolutely outstanding; the work with the amplifier on Mick Mars' guitar is unprecedented and the most creative use I\u2019ve ever heard from an amp. At the beginning of the song, the guitar sounds like an engine revving before it transitions into a hard, grainy, gritty, and fast guitar riff that builds until it becomes the melody. Mick Mars plays extremely fast and with extreme dexterity on this track, and not only is it indicative of his unique style and another example of him carving out his own sound in the world of the electric guitar, but it\u2019s awesome. The guitar melodies on this song are incredible, and the solo, which features Mick Mars on the talkbox alongside his rapid guitar playing and Tommy Lee\u2019s stellar drumming, is so epic. The drumming from Tommy Lee on this song is perhaps as important as Mick Mars' guitar playing, though, if not more important because his drums not only keep time and keep Mick Mars from going off the beat, but they also drive the song and push it forward with nuanced techniques and extreme dexterity. Tommy Lee goes HAM on the drums with this track, and it works really well. Vince Neil is spectacular on the chorus, but some of his lyrics and delivery on the verses leaves a bit to be desired. The part where the song slows down and Vince Neil becomes the focal point of the track is cool, but it caught me a bit off guard at first. It\u2019s a great part of the song and perhaps the best verse, but it\u2019s a tonal shift for sure. This track is a tribute to bassist Nikki Sixx, who overdosed and almost died a few years before this album was released, and although Nikki Sixx is not really present on this song with the bass, the rest of the band members pick up the slack masterfully.\u201cSame Ol' Situation (S.O.S.)\u201d: The nuance, unique style, originality, and mastery of the pop metal / glam metal genre that I heard on \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d & \u201cKickstart My Heart\u201d is quickly fading away. The album is becoming more formulaic and generic with each track I\u2019m hearing, the lyrics are getting progressively worse, and Vince Neil\u2019s vocals are getting worse as well. The vocals from Vince Neil on this track are not an example of his vocals fitting glam metal but being bad in any other genre, but an example of his vocals just being flat-out bad. He mumbles through words on the verses and has a flow that sounds like Elvis Presley if his voice was pitched up two octaves and he tried to sing on a pop metal track. The lyrics on this song are really weird because the subject matter is about a girl named Cindy who curves Vince Neil and decides to date (and eventually get married to) another girl instead, and Vince Neil responds to that by saying \u201cgirls will be girls.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if this track is supposed to be accepting or making fun of homosexuality, but if it\u2019s trying to be accepting of it, it missed the mark big time. The guitar solo from Mick Mars is alright on this song, but his guitar melody is distorted way too much by noisy feedback, and Tommy Lee\u2019s drumming is subdued and relegated. It\u2019s an overall filler track.\u201cSticky Sweet\u201d: The pros about this track: The guitar solo from Mick Mars is very good and shows signs of life on this album that haven\u2019t been present in the last two tracks. The guitar melody itself is rather dull and boring, but the wailing notes and traditional doom metal playing style on the guitar solo is epic, especially the overlay of Mick Mars on the electric guitar with Nikki Sixx on the bass. The cons about this track: Quite literally everything else. This song is literally about cum (and Vince Neil lusting after a girl by calling her \u201csticky sweet\u201d in reference to him cumming when he thinks about her). The lyrics, vocals, and flow from Vince Neil on this song are absolute cringe in its most pure and unfiltered form. The drums from Tommy Lee are lackluster and uninspired, and as I mentioned already, the guitar melody is dull, as if Mick Mars knew how stupid the song was and decided to put as little effort as possible into everything except the solo. Complete garbage.\u201cShe Goes Down\u201d: Wow, this song is actually horrible. I can\u2019t believe Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx, and Mick Mars, all of whom know what M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce is supposed to sound like and how good glam metal is supposed to be made (evidence for that can be found in \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d & \u201cKickstart My Heart\u201d), and all of whom are good (i.e. Vince Neil) or very good (i.e. everyone else) musicians, actually made this song and thought \u201cyeah, let\u2019s put this on the album.\u201d The same album that has some of their best songs ever. This track is arguably one of the sleaziest, slimiest, and all-around worst tracks in the history of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, pop metal, and glam metal. The song is literally about getting blowjobs from Southern girls in the back of classic cars. It\u2019s songs like this one, \u201cSticky Sweet,\u201d and \u201cSlice Of Your Pie\u201d that give women reason to believe that all men suck, because these songs certainly paint the image of the most despicable and disgusting guys around. Rebelliousness is a good theme for music (especially genres like rock, glam, pop metal, and metal), but lusting over underage girls, cum, and blowjobs? That\u2019s stuff nobody wants to hear about, let alone entire songs dedicated to them. I can\u2019t believe these guys actually recorded this song and said \u201cyeah, this one\u2019s a banger, let\u2019s put it on the album.\u201d An instant skip.\u201cDon\u2019t Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\u201d: An 80\u2019s glam metal power ballad. This song has some cheesy lyrics and some bad production choices, but it is one of the better tracks on this album despite being mid. The verses from Vince Neil have cheesy lyrics that talk about lost love in a way that\u2019s campy, tropey, and cliche, as one of my least favorite quotables on Vince Neil\u2019s verses is \u201cIf we blame it on anything, let\u2019s blame it on the rain.\u201d However, although the verses have subpar flows and bad lyrics, the choruses in between the verses, where Vince Neil says \u201cThat\u2019s alright, that\u2019s okay\u201d are the best parts of the song, as the vocals are good, the delivery is strong, and it\u2019s one of the first real displays of emotion I\u2019ve heard from Vince Neil on this album. The choruses definitely sound genuine and real, and it adds a lot to the track. Unfortunately, when the refrain starts and basically dominates the last two minutes of the track, the song loses all sense of originality, as the final two minutes of the track are just Vince Neil repeating \u201cGirl, don\u2019t go away mad / Girl, just to away\u201d with a mid guitar solo from Mick Mars breaking it up. Drums from Tommy Lee are solid on this song, as is the bassline from Nikki Sixx, but the song, despite its structure and appeal to me as an 80\u2019s glam power ballad, is not good.\u201cTime For Change (feat. Skid Row)\u201d: It\u2019s cool that this song is a collab between two of the top pop / glam metal bands of the 80\u2019s M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce & Skid Row, and to hear Vince Neil & Skid Row\u2019s lead singer Sebastian Bach harmonizing on the chorus was pretty epic, but this song just straight up sucks. The guitar work from Mick Mars is lazy at best, as his guitar solo is lackluster, his guitar melody is listless, and he plays as though his heart isn\u2019t in it; the drums from Tommy Lee are formulaic and bland; and Nikki Sixx might as well not even be on the song the bassline is so subdued and muted. As for Vince Neil, the lyrics, and the vocals on this song, it\u2019s another L. The lyrics sound like they were written for a Hannah Montana song, specifically one of the ones on Hannah Montana 2 that\u2019s a misguided attempt at an 80\u2019s pop power ballad, the vocals from Vince Neil sound like Sebastian Bach from Skid Row mixed with Corey Feldman, and the chorus is overblown and gaudy; an attempt at a righteous song with a \u201cgood message\u201d to rectify all the tracks about cum, underage girls, blowjobs, and making fun of homosexuals. The message \u201cNow it\u2019s time for change / Nothing stays the same\u201d might as well have been stolen from a Hallmark greeting card; even Hannah Montana\u2019s songs had deeper messages and meanings than this trash. An underwhelming way to end an underwhelming album.M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. A band I know more about than many of my favorite bands or artists from watching VH1 Behind The Music documentaries with my dad, and listening to their music in my dad\u2019s Pop Metal genre for years whenever I rode with him in the car. Similarly, I know a lot about Queen, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Poison, Boston, and The Beatles from watching these documentaries and listening to their hit songs with my dad. Now, this pop / glam metal group comprised of Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx, and Mick Mars is one of many Los Angeles-based bands in the glam metal genre trying to make a name for themselves across the 80\u2019s (others included Skid Row, Slaughter, Poison, and many others [Guns N' Roses was LA-based, but a bit harder and more metal in their sound]), and according to most critics, they peaked with this album. This project was M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s magnum opus. For their sake, I hope these critics only listened to \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d & \u201cKickstart My Heart,\u201d then made that claim. The majority of this album is terrible. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce is definitely a band that embodies the rebellious sex, drugs & rock & roll lifestyle, and that came through quite a lot on this album, but better on some tracks than others. Conveying the \u201cdrugs\u201d aspect of that lifestyle was where M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce found the most success on here. \u201cDr. Feelgood,\u201d a track about a drug dealer on Los Angeles' Sunset Strip, and \u201cKickstart My Heart,\u201d a track dedicated to Nikki Sixx\u2019s heroin overdose, were the two best songs on the album because they had the best individual performances, best lyrics, and best vocals. Guitarist Mick Mars went absolutely HAM with his melodies and solos on both of those songs, while Tommy Lee used \u201cKickstart My Heart\u201d as a platform for his drumming and Nikki Sixx took \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d to showcase his skills on the bass guitar. When it came to conveying the \u201csex\u201d element, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce failed miserably. Subject matters on this album included making fun of bisexual girls (\u201cSame Ol' Situation (S.O.S.)\u201d), cum (\u201cSticky Sweet\u201d), lusting over underage girls (\u201cSlice Of Your Pie\u201d), and blowjobs (\u201cShe Goes Down\u201d), none of which are remotely close to being good. The pop metal power ballads on this album \u201cWithout You\u201d & \u201cDon\u2019t Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\u201d are generic and listless, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce fails to do anything to differentiate themselves besides the two best tracks. Without those, this album might as well be a rejected demo tape from a Sunset Strip glam metal band in the 80\u2019s that a record company refused to sign.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released September 14, 1975Genres: AOR, Classic Rock, Pop Rock, FolkTracks:Magic Man \u2013 10Dreamboat Annie (Fantasy Child) \u2013 9.8Crazy On You \u2013 10Soul Of The Sea \u2013 9.7Dreamboat Annie \u2013 9.6White Lightning And Wine \u2013 8.6(Love Me Like Music) I\u2019ll Be Your Song \u2013 8.9Sing Child \u2013 8.4How Deep It Goes \u2013 10Dreamboat Annie (Reprise) \u2013 10Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cMagic Man\u201d: What a perfect introduction to Heart and to this album. This song is a straight up banger that introduces Heart\u2019s unique musical style perfectly. From Ann Wilson\u2019s sultry, seductive, smooth, and powerful vocals, to Nancy Wilson\u2019s amazing work with the pulsing and consistent electric guitar melody and the incredibly epic electric guitar solo, to Steve Fossen\u2019s great bass guitar work that sets up the electric guitar melody perfectly, to Howard Leese\u2019s synth infusion about \u00be of the way through the track that appears after the guitar solo and carries the song to the next chorus: This song is the quintessential Heart song. The lyrics and vocals from Ann Wilson are amazing (they\u2019re seductive, sultry, and sensual, which makes for an awesome juxtaposition with the hard rock instrumental), and the electric guitar work from her sister Nancy Wilson is epic as well. It\u2019s obvious that Nancy Wilson drew inspiration from other hard rock guitarists of the time, but her style on this song is distinctly her own. It\u2019s not easy to differentiate yourself in a genre where the electric guitar is used on pretty much every song that\u2019s released, so finding a guitarist who\u2019s able to craft their own unique sound is special. Nancy Wilson did that on this song, and I hope she continues to impress me on this album. Great song, incredible intro to this album.\u201cDreamboat Annie (Fantasy Child)\u201d: Wow. A folk rock song with Nancy Wilson on the acoustic guitar. That\u2019s certainly not what I expected after hearing that banger hard rock intro, but it\u2019s an amazing song and a perfect interlude to reset and completely shift the mood. The acoustic guitar melody from Nancy Wilson on this track is absolutely awesome; it reminds me of something Jimmy Page would make on a Led Zeppelin folk rock song. Ann Wilson sounds great on vocals with this track, and her lyrics have a hint of psychedelia and a very mellow motif, as her descriptions of sailing coupled with the ocean sounds at the beginning of the song make for an awesome chill, laid-back, and low-key track. A few of her vocal annunciations hold this song back from being a 10, but other than those, it\u2019s an incredible song.\u201cCrazy On You\u201d: The acoustic guitar sound from \u201cDreamboat Annie (Fantasy Child)\u201d is carried beautifully into the intro of this song (another amazing job by Nancy Wilson), but after about 40 seconds of acoustic guitar, the melody picks up speed and crescendos into an epic and amazing electric guitar riff that\u2019s quite possibly one of the hardest guitar riffs of all time, especially considering the intro and Michael Derosier\u2019s amazing drumming surrounding it. Nancy Wilson is spectacular with the electric guitar on this track, and Michael Derosier is another star of the show in terms of the production, as his drumming throughout the song pairs amazingly with the electric guitar melody and sounds absolutely epic. Of course, Ann Wilson\u2019s vocal performance can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed, as she does an amazing job delivering smooth and sultry vocals with great lyrics on the verses, then going crazy and delivering evocative and powerful vocals on the chorus. The bass solo from Steve Fossen is also very cool, as I expected the solo to be done by Nancy Wilson with the electric guitar, but the bassist getting a solo was a pleasant and deserved surprise. This song is another quintessential Heart song and served as one of the coolest MCU intros for Adam Warlock in Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3.\u201cSoul Of The Sea\u201d: It\u2019s amazing how Heart was able to take their style of smooth, sultry, seductive vocals and epic acoustic and electric guitar and apply it to progressive rock with this song. This track starts off with some ocean noises and then transitions into two smooth, laid-back, low-key, and mellow verses from Ann Wilson which have great vocals and lyrics that tell a story within a metaphor (as she talks about drifting at sea and finding her way, but uses it as a metaphor for her life). These first two verses and the acoustic guitar melody from Nancy Wilson that accompanies them has a sound that reminds me of a combination between Styx\u2019s \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d and Seal\u2019s \u201cKiss From A Rose.\u201d The percussion from Michael Derosier is light and airy, which adds to the mellow sound of the verses. Now, after the second verse, though, this song launches into a far more epic and prog-rock-esque sound, as Nancy Wilson\u2019s acoustic guitar turns into an electric guitar, but keyboardist Howard Leese picks up the slack by continuing the acoustic guitar melody, but turning it into more prog-rock-style riffs rather than a smooth jam. Ann Wilson\u2019s vocals on this part sound similar to Led Zeppelin\u2019s Robert Plant, and it\u2019s clear this part is supposed to be Heart\u2019s take on a Led Zeppelin song. They definitely did Led Zeppelin justice, as it has the same style, but it\u2019s distinctly a Heart song. The song then returns to the smooth and mellow sound after the epic prog rock verse, and Ann Wilson finishes out the song accompanied by some synths from Howard Leese to go with the acoustic guitar and airy percussion. Another amazingly epic song.\u201cDreamboat Annie\u201d: Everything about this song was great, except my man Robert Fisher (the backup guitarist) on the mandolin. The mandolin melody which ran behind the second verse and last two choruses was distracting and unnecessary, as it added an unnecessary twang to the song that sounded like bluegrass music, which is a terrible genre. Ann Wilson\u2019s vocals on this song are spectacular, the lyrics are great, mellow, rather metaphorical, and somewhat psychedelic, and she does a great job using the backing vocals to her advantage on the chorus. The acoustic guitar melody from Nancy Wilson was great, as I\u2019ve come to expect great things from Nancy Wilson and she hasn\u2019t disappointed me yet, and it was almost like a faster and more flushed-out version of the acoustic guitar melody on \u201cDreamboat Annie (Fantasy Child).\u201d This song would\u2019ve been a 10 if Robert Fisher hadn\u2019t brought the bluegrass cringe factor into the song.\u201cWhite Lightning And Wine\u201d: The first song where I\u2019ve been disappointed and underwhelmed by Ann Wilson\u2019s vocal performance. She\u2019s an immensely talented vocalist, there\u2019s no doubt about that; she\u2019s definitely gunning for a spot in my top 5 GOAT female vocalists list, but on this song, she falls victim to oversinging on the verses and on the chorus. The lyrics on the verses portray Ann Wilson as a maneater who only uses men for sex, and paired with her subpar vocal performance, they\u2019re not very good. The instrumental on this song is fire, though, as drum pattern from Michael Derosier is great, Nancy Wilson does really well with the electric guitar (as she often does; her final guitar solo on this song channels Jimi Hendrix from his Band Of Gypsys days while also remaining entirely true to her own sound), and the cowbell really brings the track together as a solid bassline (although, the only thing I could think of while hearing it was Christopher Walken on SNL as Bruce Dickinson saying \u201cI gotta have more cowbell\u201d). The production on this song is fire, but Ann Wilson on vocals leaves a lot to be desired.\u201c(Love Me Like Music) I\u2019ll Be Your Song\u201d: Definitely a 70\u2019s power ballad meant to hit hard on the charts. The lyrics on this song are the worst part of it, as they\u2019re pretty cheesy and campy; very dumbed-down descriptions of love and not what I\u2019ve come to expect from Heart, but everything else on this song makes up for the fact that the lyrics aren\u2019t very good. Ann Wilson; much like some of my other favorite female vocalists like Sabrina Carpenter, Christina Aguilera, Justine Skye, and Ava Max; has a voice that could sing the phone book and make it sound good, so she does just that with this track. She does the most with her vocals on the verses and chorus of this song, and her smooth and sultry voice really helps cut through the cheesiness of the lyrics. Nancy Wilson with the acoustic guitar, Howard Leese with the keyboards, and Michael Derosier with the drums really help out as well, as they create a beat that\u2019s mellow, chill, and laid-back, making the power ballad sound more genuine and authentic despite its manufactured and bland lyrics. Heart dodged a bullet on this song by just being a great band.\u201cSing Child\u201d: Cheesy, weird, and mid at best lyrics and a slightly above average vocal performance from Ann Wilson on this song, but the production and the solos on this song are extremely fire, so the slack from the mid verses and average chorus is picked up by the amazing performances of Nancy Wilson on the electric guitar, Michael Derosier on the drums, and Robert Fisher on the flute. This song definitely takes a lot of inspiration from the discography of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, as the electric guitar riffs on the melody are just longer versions of the iconic riffs from \u201cFoxey Lady,\u201d and the flute solo was undoubtedly put on this song because The Jimi Hendrix Experience did it first on \u201cIf 6 Was 9.\u201d However, although these elements are pretty much taken straight out of The Jimi Hendrix Experience\u2019s catalog, they have nuance and originality added to them that make them sound like they belong in a Heart song. The electric guitar solo from Nancy Wilson was captivating (undoubtedly inspired by Jimi Hendrix in his jam band days with Band Of Gypsys, but fire nonetheless), the drumming from Michael Derosier was spectacular, and that flute solo sounded a lot better on this song than it did on \u201cIf 6 Was 9\u201d by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Ann Wilson might\u2019ve faltered on this track, but nobody else did.\u201cHow Deep It Goes\u201d: This song is just amazing. The vocals from Ann Wilson on this track are beautiful and evocative, the lyrics are amazing and indicative of some of Heart\u2019s best songwriting on this album so far (the lyrical level is up there with tracks like \u201cMagic Man,\u201d \u201cCrazy On You,\u201d \u201cSoul Of The Sea,\u201d and all variations of \u201cDreamboat Annie\u201d), and the production is outstanding. Ann Wilson is able to shine with smooth, sultry, and somewhat melancholy vocals on this track, which has a mellow instrumental curated by spaced-out and subtle drumming from Michael Derosier, an acoustic guitar melody from Nancy Wilson that sounds like a much softer and more folky version of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy),\u201d and some great orchestral-sounding instruments like violin and clarinet that give the track a grandiose sound, and the clarinet even sounds sort of like the one used on part 1 of Pink Floyd\u2019s epic \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond, Pts. 1-5.\u201d It\u2019s not one of Heart\u2019s banger hard rock tracks, but it\u2019s a beautiful and mellow song that captures the best of Ann Wilson\u2019s vocals and Nancy Wilson\u2019s mastery of the acoustic guitar.\u201cDreamboat Annie (Reprise)\u201d: Over a great piano instrumental from Howard Leese, this track takes the best parts from \u201cDreamboat Annie (Fantasy Child)\u201d and \u201cDreamboat Annie\u201d and combines them into one track which sounds like the best version of the song. The clarinet that was included on \u201cHow Deep It Goes\u201d and sounds like Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond, Pts. 1-5\u201d makes a triumphant return on this track, and on here, it even adopts a sound that\u2019s similar to Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway To Heaven.\u201d The violins from \u201cHow Deep It Goes\u201d also return on this track, and they give the song a sense of grandiosity and epicness that sounds kind of like Electric Light Orchestra. This song sounds like an incorporation of all of the sounds used on this album to this point, and it\u2019s the perfect outro to this album because it encapsulates all of the musical influences and musical styles that have been used thus far on the album, as well as finishing the trilogy of \u201cDreamboat Annie\u201d in a song that has the best vocals, best production, and best lyrics of any of the versions. Nancy Wilson does a great job with the acoustic guitar, and Ann Wilson dazzles on vocals once again. Amazing outro.What an amazing introduction to Heart. I expected this album to be good because I\u2019d already heard \u201cMagic Man\u201d & \u201cCrazy On You\u201d and knew they were both amazing songs, but I had no idea this album would be a well-executed concept album playing around the character of Dreamboat Annie (a character that\u2019s based on Heart\u2019s lead singer Ann Wilson) that has all hits and no misses! This album is excellent. Ann Wilson is arguably a top 5 all-time GOAT female vocalist, and more albums will tell if she takes a spot away from one of the women who are already on that list, and Nancy Wilson is the GOAT female guitarist and is gunning for a spot in the top 5 all-time GOAT guitarists list that I have. Her style is so unique and so distinctly her; she draws inspiration from other artists, but her style is hers and no one else\u2019s. Much like how guitarists like Jimi Hendrix (the all-time undisputed GOAT who wrote the book on the instrument), David Gilmour, Eddie Hazel, Slash, and Eddie Van Halen have distinct styles that, when heard, they can be easily distinguished, Nancy Wilson has that quality in her playing as well. Her work with the electric and acoustic guitars on this album is amazing, as I\u2019ve never seen anyone, not even Jimi Hendrix, play both instruments that well and with that much consistency. There isn\u2019t a bad guitar moment on this album. The percussion work from drummer Michael Derosier is another highlight of this album, as he sets up amazing drum patterns for Ann Wilson & Nancy Wilson to go to town on with epic vocals and great guitar. The keyboard work from Howard Leese and the basslines from bassist Steve Fossen are not as noticeable on this album, but they\u2019re definitely necessary, and when spotlighted, those guys go hard and make the most of their time. There were a few songs where Ann Wilson struggled a little bit vocally, as she tried to oversing sometimes, and some tracks where lyrics took a backseat, but Heart is such a great band that they were able to overcome such adversities with little to no disruption. Incredibly epic album.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Released August 25, 2023Genres: Sophisti-Pop, Chick-fil-A Jazz, JazzTracks:Online Shopping \u2013 6.3Witchcraft (feat.

Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah) \u2013 1.2[Instrumental track \u201cSir Fauntleroy\u201d omitted from review]Reviewer\u2019s Notes: \u201cOnline Shopping\u201d: I\u2019m immensely disappointed with this intro. James Fauntleroy\u2019s music has always been elusive and shrouded in mystery, as his solo music is very sparsely available and not well documented on any music streaming or music knowledge websites, and his four albums as the frontman of the sophisti-pop & R&B band Cocaine 80\u2019s aren\u2019t easy to come by either. This album is the first real project from James Fauntleroy that I\u2019ve had easy access to, so I jumped at the chance to listen to it. James Fauntleroy is a top 5 GOAT male vocalist, so I figured a collab album between him and Terrace Martin, a producer who specializes in anything surrounding jazz fusion (i.e. sophisti-pop and jazz rap) who worked on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp A Butterfly (an album on which James Fauntleroy was featured multiple times), would be amazing and a full realization of his potential in both sophisti-pop & R&B. Unfortunately, this song is not good. Terrace Martin does a pretty good job with the oboe melody at the beginning of the track, but as the song progresses, the oboe sounds more and more like \u201cChick-fil-A jazz\u201d (which is smooth jazz basically used for background music). Besides the oboe melody and eventual oboe solo at the end of the song, the production from Terrace Martin is relatively minimalist and relies on a very basic chord progression to push it through. James Fauntleroy\u2019s vocals, lyrics, and flows are all mid at best on this song, which is shocking considering how great he normally is in all of those departments. The vocals are subdued and half-baked, as James Fauntleroy sings like he\u2019s just going through the motions, the lyrics comparing a girl James Fauntleroy met on a dating site to an item purchased online are tone-deaf and cringy, and the flows prevent this song from being classified as elegant pop as well as sophisti-pop. The obvious jazz and R&B elements make this song sophisti-pop, but James Fauntleroy\u2019s helter-skelter flows make the song sound disjointed and undoubtedly not elegant. This song was bad, and hopefully not a sign of things to come.\u201cLike It Like That (feat. Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah)\u201d: The first real signs of life on this album, and those signs of life are mainly provided by Terrace Martin\u2019s jazzy and funky bassline and drum pattern. Terrace Martin does a great job bringing the funk and bringing more uptempo jazz sounds into this song with his production, as that drum pattern, bassline, and trumpet licks are all well-executed. Now, unfortunately, James Fauntleroy continues to be lackluster and mid when it comes to vocals, lyrics, and flows. On the last two tracks, he had some of the worst lyrical and vocal performances I\u2019ve ever heard from him throughout his illustrious career, and while I know he can do better, I\u2019ve not seen it yet on this album. The trumpet solo from Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, an American modern jazz musician who\u2019s been making music since the early 2000\u2019s, was average at best, as it sounded somewhat out-of-place and off-putting and was carried pretty hard by the Terrace Martin bass guitar and drums. The lyrics on this song are terrible, especially James Fauntleroy\u2019s \u201cla-la-la-la\u201d breaks between the verses, and this song has an extremely shallow subject matter and phoned-in vocals. This song might\u2019ve been good if James Fauntleroy had brought his A-game, but he definitely didn\u2019t.James Fauntleroy is a top 5 all-time GOAT male vocalist. This album doesn\u2019t change that, but it certainly doesn\u2019t reflect what an amazing artist he is and how great his vocals can be. James Fauntleroy released his last album with Cocaine 80\u2019s in 2013 with The Flower Of Life, which was (to my recollection) an amazing album and a fitting ending to the supergroup that was Cocaine 80\u2019s. James Fauntleroy has worked with GOATs like Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, JAY-Z, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Chris Brown, Rihanna, and many others over the course of his career (as a songwriter, producer, and vocalist), and his influence is incredible. Not only was James Fauntleroy the frontman of Cocaine 80\u2019s, a band which included No I.D. as its main producer, Steve Wyreman on guitar, and Kevin Randolph on keyboards, but he is also the founder of the 1500 Or Nothin' producer collective and a member of the supergroup The Y\u2019s, which was him with Justin Timberlake & Timbaland. He\u2019s a great songwriter, an amazing vocalist, and a great producer as well, but none of those attributes are reflected on this garbage album. How could a collaboration between James Fauntleroy and Terrace Martin, one of the main architects behind To Pimp A Butterfly and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s signature jazz rap style, be this bad? This album is sophisti-pop, since it\u2019s an obvious fusion of pop, R&B, and jazz, but it\u2019s also what I like to call \u201cChick-fil-A jazz,\u201d a classification that I will be using from now on in my genre tags on the page. Chick-fil-A jazz is the smooth jazz music that\u2019s played on the speakers at Chick-fil-A. It\u2019s background jazz music that\u2019s not meant to be listened to intently; it\u2019s smooth jazz, essentially. This album has terrible lyrics, bad subject matter on every one of its songs, bad features from the jazz musicians (as their contributions to these instrumentals were trash), and production from Terrace Martin that was hit-and-miss. Although they have a rapport (they\u2019ve worked together multiple times), Terrace Martin doesn\u2019t seem to understand James Fauntleroy\u2019s style or his strengths as an artist, and James Fauntleroy doesn\u2019t seem to respect Terrace Martin enough to put forth any kind of effort on these songs. I was really looking forward to hearing what this album had to offer, but what it had to offer was a collection of bad sophisti-pop and smooth jazz songs that are barely acceptable for the Chick-fil-A speakers.", "autor_orig": "Key Of Siych Reviews", "titulo_orig": "All Albums I\u2019ve Reviewed (with Ratings)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "he says he\u2019s leaving to the places he made business with, to go relax or hide in any case its probably to relax", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "He is telling his opponent or enemy, as you say ,that he killed his hitmen and since the hitmens womens are know widows  which go to ariel.", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Ariel is acting sarcastic and psycho funny by saying his opponent he\u2019s giving a gift like coffin or death.", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Ariel is saying that he feels getting used to killing two or three, which means he kills for a living and gets in the feeling.", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "At this point, ariel sounds like a sicario (hitman) saying he doesn\u2019t want a lot of people hiring him to kill innocent people he never knew", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Ariel is saying to his opposer do not mess with him or talk trash by warning him he\u2019s a Narco(in the cartel)", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "What ariel is trying to say is he\u2019s telling his enemy or \u201cprey\u201d what he wants his coffin which is a reference Narcos used to their opposers there going to kill them.", "autor_orig": "Ariel Camacho Y Los Plebes Del Rancho", "titulo_orig": "El Toro Encartado", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "This line is explaining that Party and his friends either smoked some good weed before coming or smoked literally an ounce of weed before coming to the party/club.

The most common external detail between instances is the presence of the words \u201cBlue Lady\u201d hand-written on each cigarette in blue ink.Subjects who consume the contents of SCP-013 through inhalation will begin to perceive themselves as a specific unidentified woman. Subjects have described the woman to be aged between 25 and 35 years old, standing approximately 1.6 metres tall with an estimated weight of between 50 and 55 kg. Additional recurring details include cropped dark hair, blue eyes, and bright blue lipstick.Immediately after consuming an instance of SCP-013, subjects will gradually begin to perceive reflections of themselves as having the features of the woman, and will gradually perceive their bodies changing to reflect her appearance over the course of the following weeks. All changes are entirely mental; the subject\u2019s body does not change outwardly, only their perception of themselves. These alterations are permanent, and cannot be reversed.SCP-013 was discovered after the suicide of an Ian Miles, packed in a large cardboard crate in his apartment. A cursory search of the apartment uncovered several hundred sketches of a figure strongly resembling the one perceived while under 013\u2019s effect. Miles' body had been found sitting at a desk, dead of a massive overdose and draped over a handwritten note, transcribed below.During the investigation of Miles' apartment, one civilian investigator became affected by 013\u2019s effect. An embedded Agent soon contacted the nearest Site; the subject, the artifact, and related evidence were extracted and contained.Currently, two hundred seventeen instances of SCP-013 cigarettes are contained at Bio-Site 66; twenty-five SCP-013 cigarettes are contained at Research Sector-09, pending future research into similar anomalous effects.Addendum: Below is the note which was acquired along with SCP-013.I see her everywhere.

In a situation where the item cannot be cleaned for more than two (2) days, local residents must be contacted and instructed not to approach the item.[Containment procedures nullified 2004]Description: SCP-011 is a Civil War memorial statue located in Woodstock, Vermont. The statue is the image of a young male soldier holding a musket at his side, and is carved out of granite quarried within the area. Occasionally, SCP-011 has been observed lifting its musket to the sky to fire at birds which attempt to land or defecate on it. Reports detail that its movements produce soft grinding sounds but do not cause it any structural failure. Oddly, the gunfire is very similar to that of a standard firearm, despite observations that the item only loads granite bullets and granite powder into the musket (which is also unharmed by the firing). In spite of its efforts, some fecal matter does manage to strike SCP-011, and it has reportedly become distressed when it has had a large amount of feces on it, on some rare occasions even firing at humans.Addendum: Those assigned to maintain SCP-011 are to see document #011-1 for instructions.Document #011-1: Maintenance Brief[Document archived 2004 \u2013 accessible to personnel with security clearance 2/011 or higher]Additional Information: SCP-011\u2019s seeming sentience has increased since the first report of activity in 1995.

They are not to be worn except by test subjects.SCP-010 are only to be removed from storage for testing.Description: SCP-010 consists of a series of six (6) apparently identical cast iron collars with numbered metal tags and one (1) remote control. The control is SCP-010-1. The collars are SCP-010-2 through 010-7. The collars contain intricate electronic components and are powered by small (5 mm diameter, 2 mm thick) 100 V batteries. These batteries are rechargeable.The remote is a heavy black box resembling an old style hand-held radio transmitter/receiver with a primitive blue/white cathode ray screen and a series of more than 100 unlabeled buttons, as well as a frequency tuner. Through trial and error, the frequencies of all six (6) currently found collars have been discovered. A label in Russian is stamped into the metal along with a logo consisting of workers building a pyramid. No official Russian corporation or government agency uses this logo or matches the words stamped into the metal.Placing the collar around the neck of a person and securing it allows one to control their every movement with the remote. It is also capable of producing an adrenal response and activating or deactivating the sympathetic nervous system. The most abnormal feature of the collars is the effect they have on the body morphology. They allow the user of the remote to reconfigure the shape of the victim to an extent that is apparently only limited by the knowledge of the programming language of the remote.Addendum 010-1: HistorySCP-010 was discovered in the basement of a lone man in the Midwestern United States after a local disappearance was connected to him. When the police raided the man\u2019s house they found SCP-010 as well as several dead bodies. One of the bodies was identified to be the man. The others were several other missing persons. Cause of death seemed to be mass suicide; however, there were signs of significant struggle first.Addendum 010-2: Disassemble experimentTest 1: SCP-010-2 taken apart piecewise, the parts labeled and several photographs taken, then reassembled.Result: After reassembly SCP-010-2 continues to function.Test 2: SCP-010-8 constructed identically to SCP-010-2 but with the closest approximations available to the unreplicable components.Result: SCP-010-8 fails to function.Test 3: Unreplicable components from SCP-010-2 placed into proper locations on SCP-010-8.Result: SCP-010-2 ceases functioning with removal of components. SCP-010-8 begins functioning.Test 4: Components returned to SCP-010-2. Replicable components in SCP-010-2 replaced randomly with replicasResult: SCP-010-2 begins functioning with return of components. Changing replicable components for replicas does not significantly reduce functionality. Replacement of a damaged transistor decreased time from transmission to effect of SCP-010-2 response to commands entered in the remote by 12%.Addendum 010-3:SCP-010 has been demonstrated to work more effectively in creating unskilled labor than for any other task.

Any personnel attempting to utilize the item without authorisation are to be terminated immediately. All personnel wishing to use the item are required to submit a filled copy of the application form (Document #120-23) to facility operators.Due to the precise timing and coordination required for efficient use of this object in an emergency, all personnel entering SCP-120\u2019s building are placed under temporary command of the facility heads Captain \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Security Detachment) (L4) and Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Research Team) (L4).All destination locations are to be kept under surveillance and armed guard. They are valuable to the Foundation but are non-critical, but any compromised destination must be immediately reported to SCP-120 personnel.Distributed Task Force Sigma-6 (\u201cPuddlejumpers\u201d) was created with the objective of protecting and maintaining SCP-120\u2019s facility and location outposts. It consists of 1 command unit and 1 defense and maintenance unit based at the SCP-120 facility at Command-\u2588\u2588; 5 units based at the destination locations, plus 5 reserve units for these; and 5 units assigned to other SCP-120 related projects.Description: SCP-120 appears to be a small child\u2019s paddling pool, pastel pink in colouration, with an inner diameter of approximately 2.5 metres and inner height of 0.3 metres. The pool appears to have been fabricated from common Earth plastics but has shown itself to be indestructible by any attempted means (see research report #120-32 for a full summary). The pool\u2019s structure and response to pressure are typical for such a pool (it will flex when pressure is applied and is soft to the touch) but has amazing tensile strength and cannot be permanently stretched or ripped.What is contained within the pool seems to be a brightly glowing, coloured, liquid-like substance, which seems to exist only partially in our dimension. It is unresponsive to manipulation by organic or inorganic means, but the substance ripples and shimmers systematically and regularly, suggesting it exists physically on another dimension.SCP-120\u2019s most interesting and useful property is used regularly by Foundation personnel. Human beings, when alive and carrying loads (including clothing) under 37.8 kilograms, are observed to fall through the pool, and are deposited at one of 11 destinations. These will be detailed in an addendum.The item will only function in this way if certain conditions are met: the subject must be genetically human; the subject must be conscious; the subject must be carrying weights of under the specified amount; and only one subject must be present on the surface. Test subjects attempting to use SCP-120 while these conditions were not met reported their feet making contact with a smooth surface underneath the liquid but no significant effects were observed.SCP-120\u2019s main use is as a potential means of evacuation for Command-\u2588\u2588 during a major emergency. It is currently stored and maintained in a fortified outbuilding of this facility. To inspect evacuation procedures, refer to document #120-22.SCP-120 was first brought to the attention of Foundation authorities on 31/08/1992. Local police authorities in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, California, were investigating reports of missing children in their jurisdiction, and discovered and reported the item on 31/08. Overwatch Command was automatically informed through the usual channels, and a small team of Foundation agents was dispatched to claim and transport the item to Site-19, where it remained for testing over the next 2 years.It was transferred to its present location at Command-\u2588\u2588 in 1994.Addendum:Document #120-7: Destructive test results for SCP-120 \u2013 24/12/1993 [Abridged version]Hand saw: 30cm \u2013 No resultIndustrial drill: Steel bit \u2013 No resultIndustrial drill: Diamond bit \u2013 No resultMunition: 9x19mm Parabellum \u2013 No resultMunition: 5.56x45mm NATO \u2013 No resultMunition: 7.62x39mm \u2013 No resultMunition: 120mm M830 HEAT \u2013 No resultCutting torch: Acetylene \u2013 No resultCutting torch: Hydrogen \u2013 No resultCutting torch: Propane \u2013 No resultCO2 laser (peak power: 100 kW) \u2013 No resultCO2 laser (peak power: 500 kW) \u2013 No resultDocument #120-10: Detailed explanation of SCP-120\u2019s capabilities and destinations \u2013 12/02/1994 [Abridged version]SCP-120 possesses the capability of instant translocation of human beings, possibly through one or more alternate dimensions. Subjects using the item are invariably deposited at one of 11 locations. These locations cycle in a specific and unchanging pattern. The 11 destinations and their locations were determined through testing with Class-D personnel carrying radio beacons. They are detailed here:Location 1: Pacific Ocean: SCP-120\u2019s liquid displays a blue glow while connected to this destination.Subjects attempting travel to this destination are deposited an average of 2 metres above the surface of the Pacific at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0S, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0W. A Foundation ship (SCPS Demeter \u2013 publicly the USS Nassau, a meteorological ship) is currently stationed at this location and personnel arriving through use of SCP-120 materialize inside the ship\u2019s cargo hold.Sensitive Foundation material or personnel can be sent here in an emergency, and the ship has provisions for storage of low-threat SCP objects, should the need arise. Class-D personnel used to \u201cdial\u201d SCP-120 can be confined and extracted by helicopter or reused, or simply terminated and their bodies retained in storage.The original Class D and radio transmitter used to determine this location were lost at sea, and might have to be recovered in the interest of secrecy, if they were to wash up on populated shores.This configuration of SCP-120 was arbitrarily designated as #1, and has no observable significance above other configurations. Destinations 2 through 11 follow in sequential order after this configuration, and return to it after a full cycle.Travel by SCP-120 to this location is not advisable during storms due to risk of injury.Location 2: Greenland: SCP-120 displays a bright white glow while dialed to this destination.Subjects travelling to this destination materialize 1.5 metres above the surface of Greenland, at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N and longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0W. A small facility was established here, under the public pretense of oil industry expansion. This facility has similar capabilities and use to the Demeter, and is additionally equipped with an airstrip and refueling facilities.Location 3: L3: Located at the Earth-Moon Lagrange Point 3. The SCP displays a deep black colour.Objects and personnel sent through the SCP to any Lagrange point (locations 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11) are effectively lost, as retrieval is impossible at our current level of technology. They may prove a possible way to remove small but threatening SCP objects, but for now, are merely an inconvenience, as sacrifice of D-personnel is required to move the SCP to its next configuration.Location 4: Himalayas: SCP-120 displays a white glow similar to when it is dialed to Location 2.Materialization occurs at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E, on a mountain in the Himalayan mountain range. Only minor changes have been made to the destination: the digging of an 8-metre hole for disposal of D-class bodies, an overhead canopy for concealment, and supplies and tenting for evacuation to this location (which should only take place in extreme circumstances).D-class personnel used for dialing are to be injected with a mixture of sedatives and neurotoxin before sending, to ensure a humane death and decrease risk of damage to the structures at Location 4.Location 5: L5: Identical to Location 3.Location 6: Sahara: SCP-120 will glow yellow.Personnel materialize at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E in a small outpost. The need for secrecy renders this facility unable to house any significant SCP object, but is ideal for evacuation of personnel and documents from Command.Location 7: Gobi: SCP-120 displays a brown glow.This destination is located at a small outpost in the Gobi desert, latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E, but is otherwise identical to the location 6 outpost. However, the expansion of SCP-4024 poses a significant threat to the outpost\u2019s operational viability.Location 8: L2: Identical to Location 3, although shows more potential for SCP disposal, being situated beyond the moon.Location 9: Mare Imbrium: The SCP displays a subdued grey glow when dialed in to this destination.This destination is on a relatively flat section of the Sea of Rains on the lunar surface. Through vast expenditure of money and D-class personnel, a small outpost has been established there, and is considered one of the Foundation\u2019s safest locations.Location 10: L4: Identical to Location 3.Location 11: L1: Identical to Location 3.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-084Object Class: EuclidSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-084 is currently under a full non-interaction order until the full extent of the emission waves has been evaluated (for detailed documentation on general FNI orders, see Document XRG-1182; for detailed documentation on FNI orders in relation to SCP-084, see Document XRG-1208A).

Direct observation and sample collection from SCP-084 is impossible, due to the effect that is emitted around/from SCP-084. SCP-084 appears to emit a form of wave or radiation that has a detrimental effect on local space-time/reality. The most pronounced aspect of this is the alteration of local space within the active area of SCP-084. Externally, the active area forms a rough \u201cdome\u201d shape of two hundred (200) meters in diameter. SCP-084 appears inside this area at random points, appearing to \u201cjump\u201d at random times, sometimes even appearing in multiple locations at once inside the active area. Internally, the space appears to be unlimited, with SCP-084 at the \u201ccenter\u201d.SCP-084 is impossible to reach due to the \u201cemitted effect\u201d. Attempts to approach SCP-084 within the active area have returned the observation that SCP-084 retains its relative position on the horizon, even after three months and twelve days of dedicated, direct travel both by vehicle and on foot. Termination tests have proved impossible, as no means of destruction are capable of physically reaching SCP-084, even when entered from outside the active area. Local space will also distort periodically. This will cause relative distances to randomly extend or contract in a \u201cflicker\u201d, causing buildings or objects to suddenly \u201cjump\u201d thousands of meters away, or \u201crush up\u201d to other points, sometimes even causing \u201coverlaps\u201d. These \u201coverlaps\u201d have a markedly detrimental effect on living tissue.The town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is assumed to have been situated in or around the original manifestation of the active area.

Births appear to be impossible, along with normal aging patterns. Suicide and/or homicide appear to be circumvented by the area of effect, with dead subjects \u201cflickering\u201d and appearing alive and unharmed several seconds after death. There are also reports of events \u201crewinding\u201d, causing things like mortal wounds to visibly \u201cfreeze\u201d and close. Subjects appear to exhibit many events of inconsistent space-time, as do most structures (for detailed observations, see Log 084-A4).Electronic devices and recording equipment do not function correctly in or around the active area. Subjects report \u201cbizarre\u201d or \u201cunsettling\u201d transmissions from video and audio recording and playback devices. This acts to totally isolate \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from the outside world, precluding any need for Foundation-enacted containment. It also appears impossible to leave the active area after a random period of time. One subject from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, found on the grass plane (see Log 084-A4), reported he had been traveling for six years.

As SCP-069 is currently on suicide watch, all requests it makes must be approved by no fewer than two (2) Level 3 personnel.If SCP-069 attempts to breach containment, it must be subdued using non-lethal methods. If SCP-069 dies, undercover agents are to be instructed to monitor reports of incidents in which individuals appear to have escaped certain death and SCP-069 is to be re-contained as soon as possible.Note: Despite the fact that SCP-069 is identical in all ways to Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, it remains an active SCP in containment, and is not to be treated as a Foundation employee. Any requests for classified information are to be denied, and visits from former co-workers without proper authorization are not allowed.Description: SCP-069 is a presumed humanoid entity of variable appearance and gender. Through an unknown ability, whenever SCP-069 is left alone with a recently deceased human body, the body will disappear and SCP-069 will take on the appearance, mannerisms, and knowledge of the recently dead individual.Through extensive experimentation, it has been shown that SCP-069 is completely indistinguishable from the individual it impersonates, matching the original individual\u2019s fingerprints, DNA, and [DATA EXPUNGED] with nearly perfect precision. SCP-069 retains no knowledge of its abilities or former impersonations. SCP-069 responds normally to injury and pain, but if killed, will rapidly decay into dust regardless of any preservation attempts. SCP-069 will then re-emerge at the site of the most recent human death. There is no known maximum range to this effect, and so far has been observed in jumps of up to 675 kilometers.SCP-069 can impersonate a single individual indefinitely. However, it will gain an overriding urge to \u201cget their life in order\u201d, including but not limited to: resolving any outstanding financial or personal obligations, visiting extended family, updating their will and testament, and other acts of closure. When questioned, SCP-069 professes no driving motivation other than a desire to straighten out their lives in the event of unforeseen injury or death.SCP-069 first came to the Foundation\u2019s attention on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/199\u2588 following reports of one John M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 City firefighter who miraculously emerged alive from a 3-alarm building fire in which 2 other firefighters and 11 civilians perished. Undercover agents attached to the local authorities were notified of a possible SCP when reports emerged that the firefighter\u2019s equipment had been damaged beyond recognition, and that it had been deemed nearly impossible for the firefighter to emerge unscathed. Approximately three weeks later, then-presumed John M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 responded to another large-scale building fire, during which he entered a smoke-filled room alone and was never found. A single civilian was rescued from the building, again nearly unharmed despite the heavy smoke reported within the building. SCP-069 was designated the following day, and rendered into Foundation custody by members of Mobile Task Force Xi-3 (\u201cBody Snatchers\u201d).Addendum 069-01: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588/200\u2588, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a guard on duty assigned to SCP-069, was killed during the containment breach of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 and subsequently impersonated by SCP-069. Although initially in denial after being informed of its identity, it has been mostly cooperative since its impersonation of a mid-level Foundation employee. Contingencies for the use of deceased Foundation employees for future SCP-069 use is under consideration.Addendum 069-02: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/200\u2588, SCP-069 attempted to commit suicide after a junior researcher accidentally informed it that the family of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had been told that Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was dead, and of their subsequent reactions.

Debriefing reports will become available as they are declassified.Description: SCP-1730 was a large complex of structures 15km northwest of the US/Mexico border within Big Bend Ranch State Park that was discovered on June 5th, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Due to the isolated nature of the complex, and the low survival rate of individuals who come in contact with it, it is possible that SCP-1730 had been previously discovered but unreported.SCP-1730 bore identifying markings and contained documents to support the claim that SCP-1730 was at one point Foundation Site-13, originally located near Nome, Alaska. This conflicted with extant records, which showed that Site-13 was a project that, while intended to be constructed in Alaska, was scrapped for the larger and more advanced Site-19 and was never completed. Flora located on-site was identified as native to the Alaskan region. How SCP-1730 came to be at its location prior to neutralization is unknown.SCP-1730 was, upon discovery, in a severe state of disrepair, and appeared to have been left abandoned for an extended period of time. The site power generator had continued to operate in a damaged state, despite a number of fuel leaks and fires throughout the facility. This resulted in intermittent power failures throughout the site, hindering exploration and rescue efforts.The origin of SCP-1730 is still unknown, as is the nature of many of the anomalous entities contained within1. It is confirmed that the 2nd through 15th2 basement levels were utilized for entity containment, though the state of that containment had deteriorated significantly.It was believed that a contingent of human survivors existed somewhere deep in the lower basement levels of the facility3. Messages written in English were discovered throughout the site, consisting of warnings such as \u201cdanger\u201d and \u201cdeath here\u201d, and other messages such as \u201cnot my body\u201d and \u201cbleed\u201d. A recurring message, \u201cWhat happened to Site-13?\u201d, was found in several different locations in the basements.Several logs of data were collected by the remaining functional site terminals, the relevant data of which is contained in the addendums below. Worth noting is that inconsistencies exist between the logs and what has been determined through exploration, including site layout, staff makeup, and contained anomalies.

While knowledge of SCP-3001 is available to personnel of any level should they wish to learn about it, research and experimentation with SCP-3001 and its associated technology is strictly limited to personnel of Level 3 and above, with special clearance designation granted from Sites 120, 121, 124, and 133.Description: SCP-3001 is a hypothesized paradoxical parallel/pocket \u201cnon-dimension\u201d accessible through the creation of a momentary Class-C \u201cBroken Entry\u201d Wormhole.1 While believed to be an infinitely extending parallel universe, SCP-3001 is almost completely devoid of any matter and has an extremely low Hume Level of 0.032,2 contradicting Kejel\u2019s Laws of Reality with the relation between Humes and spacetime. This phenomenon causes matter inside it to decay at an extremely low rate, and damage that would otherwise prove fatal does not impede any biological/electronic function; simulations suggest an organism can lose more than 70% of their body\u2019s tissue and still operate normally, as long as at least 40% of the brain remains. However, prolonged exposure will cause said matter to gradually approach SCP-3001\u2019s own Hume Level, resulting in severe tissue/structural damage as the matter\u2019s own Hume Field begins to disintegrate.SCP-3001 was initially discovered on January 2, 2000, at Site-120, a facility dedicated to testing and containing reality-bending technology. Dr. Robert Scranton and his wife Dr. Anna Lang were Head Researchers at Site-120, and were developing an experimental device, called the \u201cLang-Scranton Stabilizer\u201d (LSS).3 Dr. Scranton was transported to SCP-3001 after unexpected seismic activity damaged several active LSS in Site-120 Reality Lab A.Initially presumed dead, Dr. Scranton has survived in SCP-3001 for at least five years, 11 months, and 21 days. During this time, he was able to record his experiences and observations within SCP-3001 through a somehow still functioning LSS control panel, which was also brought into SCP-3001 with him through the Class-C \u201cBroken Entry\u201d Wormhole. These recordings were later recovered upon the panel\u2019s sudden return, an unexpected side effect from testing improved reality-bending technology; these logs are the basis of SCP-3001 study. Despite new technologies being developed, retrieval and re-integration of Dr. Scranton has been unsuccessful. His current physical and mental states, if he is still alive, are unknown.

SCP-093 must remain on a mirror at all times and under video surveillance. Admittance into the area of SCP-093\u2019s containment must be authorized only with proper video recording and subject retrieval procedures in place. Any attempt to use SCP-093 outside of an approved test will be dealt with severely, up to and including termination.Description: SCP-093 is a primarily red disc carved from a stone composite resembling cinnabar, with circular engravings and unknown symbols carved at 0.5 cm depth around the entire object. Deeper cuts are present on SCP-093 with a depth of 1 to 1.5 cm. SCP-093 is 7.62 cm in diameter and fits comfortably into most palms without abrasion. SCP-093 will change hue when held by a living individual. The colors taken by SCP-093 are still being researched to establish a link. Current belief holds that the changes depend upon regrets carried by the holder.If SCP-093 is removed from a mirror and not held by a person, it will seek out the nearest mirror-like surface. SCP-093 has been observed to travel in the largest possible circle while rolling, building up phenomenal speed. The mechanism of this acceleration is currently unknown. If an obstacle is between SCP-093 and the nearest mirror-like surface, it will use this momentum to punch through the obstacle and continue on its course at this speed. It will only stop when a mirror-like surface is contacted. Despite tremendous impact velocities, no damage will be dealt to SCP-093 or the mirror.Additional Notes: No records exist to clarify the nature of SCP-093\u2019s discovery or presence in the Foundation.

Dependent upon the duration of their stay in SCP-3008, a cover story may need to be generated prior to their release.Any other entities exiting SCP-3008 are to be terminated.Description: SCP-3008 is a large retail unit previously owned by and branded as IKEA, a popular furniture retail chain. A person entering SCP-3008 through the main entrance and then passing out of sight of the doors will find themselves translocated to SCP-3008-1. This displacement will typically go unnoticed as no change will occur from the perspective of the victim; they will generally not become aware until they try to return to the entrance.SCP-3008-1 is a space resembling the inside of an IKEA furniture store, extending far beyond the limits of what could physically be contained within the dimensions of the retail unit. Current measurements indicate an area of at least 10km2 with no visible external terminators detected in any direction. Inconclusive results from the use of laser rangefinders has led to the speculation that the space may be infinite.SCP-3008-1 is inhabited by an unknown number of civilians trapped within prior to containment. Gathered data suggests they have formed a rudimentary civilisation within SCP-3008-1, including the construction of settlements and fortifications for the purpose of defending against SCP-3008-2.SCP-3008-2 are humanoid entities that exist within SCP-3008-1. While superficially resembling humans they possess exaggerated and inconsistent bodily proportions, often described as being too short or too tall. They possess no facial features and in all observed cases wear a yellow shirt and blue trousers consistent with the IKEA employee uniform.SCP-3008-1 has a rudimentary day-night cycle, determined by the overhead lighting within the space activating and deactivating at times consistent with the opening and closing times of the original retail store. During the \u201cnight\u201d instances of SCP-3008-2 will become violent towards all other lifeforms within SCP-3008-1. During these bouts of violence they have been heard to vocalise phrases in English that are typically variations of \u201cThe store is now closed, please exit the building\u201d. Once \u201cday\u201d begins SCP-3008-2 instances immediately become passive and begin moving throughout SCP-3008-1 seemingly at random. They are unresponsive to questioning or other verbal cues in this state, though will react violently if attacked.SCP-3008-1 is known to have one or more exits located within, though these exits do not appear to have a fixed position, making it difficult to leave SCP-3008-1 once inside. Using any other door besides the main entrance to enter the structure or breaking through the walls of the retail unit leads into the non-anomalous interior of the original store.Since containment began 14 individuals have managed to exit SCP-3008. Following extensive debriefing all individuals have been administered amnestics and released.Incident 3008-1: At 00:37 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/200\u2588 a human male exited SCP-3008, followed 10 seconds later by an instance of SCP-3008-2.

No marks or engravings are visible on its surface due to the large amount of corrosion. Attempts to remove the rust chemically or mechanically have had no success.SCP-513 was recovered by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 while carrying out Containment Reestablishment Procedure Mu at Site-\u2588\u2588. SCP-513\u2019s clapper was firmly held in place by several strips of duct tape. A single scrap of paper was found along with SCP-513 (see Addendum).Any noise produced by SCP-513 immediately induces strong anxiety in all sentient beings who hear it, regardless of their previous mental status. Exposure victims report feelings of being watched by an unseen entity and present elevated heart rates and blood pressure. Roughly one hour after exposure, exposure victims begin to catch glimpses of SCP-513-1 when opening doors, walking past mirrors, turning their heads, or performing any other actions that result in a sudden change in visual perception. Upon being sighted, SCP-513-1 reportedly turns away and runs out of view before disappearing without a trace. Questioning of bystanders indicates that SCP-513-1 is invisible to those who have not been exposed to SCP-513.Sightings of SCP-513-1 reoccur every 14 to 237 minutes. This \u201cstalking\u201d behavior inevitably causes extreme sleep deprivation, as victims are frequently disturbed by SCP-513-1\u2019s presence in their quarters. Victims able to fall asleep before SCP-513-1\u2019s appearance report being physically assaulted by it. Upon the victim\u2019s awakening, SCP-513-1 flees as usual (see Experiment Log 513). This sleep deprivation, along with the mental stress caused by SCP-513-1\u2019s behavior, invariably induces paranoia, aggression, hypervigilance, and depression. All test cases but one have ended with the test subject\u2019s suicide.Descriptions of SCP-513-1\u2019s appearance are largely unreliable. Test subjects are unable to provide complete accounts of sightings due to their exhaustion, degraded mental health, and disruptive hypervigilance.

In the event of a containment breach, an alert will be sounded that all personnel should watch for any brief flickering movements in the corner of their eyes, and to report immediately if one is sighted.Description: SCP-372 is a creature of unknown genus, approximately 2 meters long from head to tail and weighing approximately 45 kilograms. It has a long, thin body with eight pairs of narrow limbs.Analysis has shown that its muscle fibers are [REDACTED], allowing for extremely fast and precise movements. Every part of the body is abnormally flexible, and the limbs are coated with small fibers that cling to almost any solid surface.In place of eyes or ears, it has [DATA EXPUNGED]. This sensory organ is capable not only of echolocation but also of detecting energy transfers, such as the electrical impulses in the brains of nearby beings. SCP-372 has learned to time its movements to those pulses, predicting the movements of any being around it.

After thorough investigation, SCP-372 was captured via [REDACTED], and it was determined that it had, for unknown reasons, been tormenting the unfortunate patient. It had confused him by periodically following him and remaining within sight of him while hiding outside the visual fields of those around him, making him believe that he was hallucinating a \u201cmonster\u201d no one else could see. Unfortunately, the patient had by this time actually become mentally unbalanced due to stress, and [DATA EXPUNGED].Log of tests on SCP-372:Participants: 2 D-Class PersonnelLocation: Empty room, 6m x 5m x 3 mTest parameters: D-1 was instructed to stand in the middle of the room, D-2 in the corner. Both were to perform a visual search of the room. SCP-372 was released into the testing room. After five minutes, armed personnel entered and ushered SCP-372 back into its holding cell, and D-1 and D-2 were debriefed.Results: After five minutes, D-1 reported no sighting, and D-2 only detected a few brief flashes.Participants: 2 D-Class PersonnelLocation: Empty room, 6m x 5m x 3 mTest parameters: D-1 and D-2 were instructed to stand in opposite corners of the room, and make a visual inspection of the room once SCP-372 was released into the containment room.Results: After five minutes, both D-class had sighted SCP-372 fifteen times (both at identical times). It is believed that SCP-372 was darting around in the spots where the blind spots in their vision overlapped, and occasionally had to break cover and dart into another one when one area was no longer overlapping.Participants: 4 D-Class PersonnelLocation: Empty room, 6m x 5m x 3 mTest parameters: D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-4 were instructed to stand in the four corners of the room and watch SCP-372.Results: Approximately 1.5 seconds after SCP-372 was introduced into the testing area, D-3 shrieked and collapsed, spurting blood from a wound on his [REDACTED] that seemed to have spontaneously appeared. D-1, D-2 and D-4 abandoned their stations and ran for the (locked) exit. D-4 began pounding on the door before he was also injured, losing one \u2588\u2588\u2588. D-1 and 2 retreated into one corner, D-1 curling up into the fetal position while D-2 stood absolutely still. No activity was reported for the remainder of the five-minute test. When the test was ended, D-3 had expired, D-4 required surgical [REDACTED], and D-1 and D-2 were not physically harmed. None of the surviving test subjects reported seeing SCP-372 at any time.Notes: Aside from what it did to that mental patient, this is the first time it\u2019s actively harmed a person. D-3 didn\u2019t really have time to do anything that pissed it off, either. Did it just get hungry? \u2013 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Addendum: Anyone pranking nervous personnel by pretending to see SCP-372 in front of them will be severely reprimanded. \u2014O5-\u2588", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-205Object Class: EuclidSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-205-1 and SCP-205-2 are contained within Chamber 52 at Site-23, under regular observation via the adjoining observation room. SCP-205-1 and SCP-205-2 are to be supplied with power and face the white projection screen on the wall opposite the observation window at all times. Chamber 52 requires monthly maintenance to ensure the continued operation of both SCP objects, their power supply and remote activation controls. Replacement parts and bulbs are kept on hand in the chamber. Maintenance is suspended during the final month of the SCP-205 cycle, occurring in April and October of each year. Should power to Chamber 52 fail it is to remain dark and sealed for a period of thirty days before local security enters to re-engage power for continued observation and containment.During maintenance it is critical that only one of the SCP-205 pair is ever turned off at a time. Should both objects lose power or otherwise cease normal operation the chamber must be sealed for a 30 day period before local security may enter to re-engage power and retrieve the remains of any personnel lost in the chamber.Pending O5 review, testing and observation is to continue before SCP-205 is to be moved to permanent storage.Description: SCP-205 is a pair of flood lamps used in photography. The light emitted by each lamp behaves in a manner unique to SCP-205 and passes completely through any surface that is not colored white. Once the light contacts a white surface it scatters and reflects as normal and loses any unnatural properties. If the light continues uninterrupted through any matter, otherwise casting no shadow, each lamp will display an unidentified young woman\u2019s shadow upon any flat white surface, such as the projection screen in Chamber 52. Whether or not this shadow corresponds to anyone living or dead has yet to be determined, although the shadow appears to re-enact a specific series of events leading up to the woman\u2019s death.Even if the lamps are slightly moved, the shadow remains distinct and does not lose focus or move along with the one lamp or the other. Only one shadow is cast although a physical person standing before two lamps would actually cast two shadows.When supplied with steady power and maintained, the SCP-205 pair will go through a six month cycle that ends on April 30th and October 31st of each year. Neither the inclusion of an extra day during a Leap Year nor intermittent operation failures change these dates, thus SCP-205\u2019s cycle appears to be tied to the standard calendar rather than a set passage of time.SCP-205 will shut off at midnight on the final day of each cycle. Any persons entering or already inside Chamber 52 when the lamps are both turned off are violently assaulted by forces unseen in a manner consistent with the fate suffered by the shadow woman, regardless of any other light sources in the room.If the lamps are shut off at the end of a standard six month cycle they can be remotely activated to immediately end the danger and begin a new cycle. If the lamps cease operating for any other reason Chamber 52 will remain dangerous and must remain sealed for at least thirty days regardless of the status of SCP-205 itself. During a dangerous phase any equipment in the room is often ransacked, but although SCP-205 itself has sometimes been moved the lamps are never damaged.On two occasions [DATA EXPUNGED] were carved into the walls. This strongly implies that [DATA EXPUNGED] displaying an awareness of current containment procedures.Overview of SCP-205\u2019s cycle: For the first month of operation, SCP-205 will display a still image of one woman in a provocative pose. Although variances have been noted in the pose and clothing of the woman, the individual displayed appears to be distinct and consistent through all cycles. During the last week of the first month, the shadow will begin to move slightly as if the individual is shifting her weight or becoming uncomfortable. Her hair and clothing will be observed to flutter in ways that do not correspond to any movement of the atmosphere within Chamber 52. By the end of the first calendar month the shadow will break her pose and spend the next eight hours moving through a series of poses that imply a photography session complete with clothing changes and short breaks, sometimes including a meal.After this session is over the shadow will constantly be in motion for the next five months, displaying a pantomime of the last days of a young model\u2019s life before she is brutally murdered at the end of the cycle. The shadow of the woman never moves beyond the boundaries of the projection screen. The shadows of objects that the woman appears to be interacting with do not appear unless they are being picked up or carried, and with the exception of the final month of the cycle any other individuals that the shadow appears to be interacting with are not seen.Although the cycle is slightly different each time certain consistencies are observed. The individual portrayed appears to have taken up photography as a hobby in addition to being a fashion model. Her behavior implies a great deal of social interaction although with a lack of intimacy and behavior that indicates living alone rather than with family or a partner. One implied sexual encounter with an unseen partner occurs in the second or third month of the cycle and exactly sixty six explicit sexual encounters occur in the final month of the cycle.During the last month of the cycle in April and October, shadows distinct from the young woman are displayed. These shadows all have exaggerated nude male physiques and horns projecting from the cranium although no phallus is ever observed, even during the sexual displays that take up the final days of the cycle. Only one shadow appears at first, interacting with the woman in a manner suggesting that they have met at a party or social gathering. The woman does not appear to notice the unusual nature of the other shadow and plays out a series of varying romantic interactions with it. The horned shadow will return to dine with the woman, engage in silent conversations and accompany her on outings. One recurring event involves the horned shadow introducing the woman to at least two other identical horned figures. After the second week of the month the woman will take photographs of one or more of the horned shadows during one of their outings, always with a non-digital camera that has been consistent through all observed viewings of the SCP-205 cycle. After this event explicit sexual encounters will begin between the woman and one of the figures, increasing in intensity and frequency until the end of the third week.During the final week of the month the woman appears to develop the film in her camera for the first time since photographing the horned shadow(s). Her reaction to the photographs is one of shock and horror, and her movements afterward suggest that she attempts to flee and seek shelter behind a locked door, presumably in her home. There she is encountered by multiple instances of the horned shadow figure which assault her repeatedly for the remainder of the week. It is strongly implied that she is killed during this process although the assaults will continue until the end of the cycle.On the last day of the cycle one of the horned shadows begins to grow larger in a manner suggesting that the figure casting it is approaching the SCP-205 lamps directly. It will eventually overcast all other shadows and at this time both lamps will be physically turned off regardless of any modifications made to prevent a halt in operation.Addendum: SCP-205-1 has been in the Foundation\u2019s possession since \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588; SCP-205-2 is identical in every way, including the serial number. It was discovered in a ransacked motel room in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588 on \u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. No sign of the identity or whereabouts of the occupant have been found, although a camera similar to the one displayed in the sixth month of the SCP-205 cycle was also recovered. Most of the contained film was ruined by exposure; see attached photo for the one image that was developed from the camera.Incident 205-76b: On 10-28-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-205-2\u2019s bulb burnt out. Researcher M. N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was sent in to Chamber 52 to replace the bulb during one of the climactic assaults. Upon the opening of Chamber 52\u2019s door, all horned shadow figures within view ceased their activity and turned towards the door. Researcher N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 resealed the chamber and refused to enter to perform maintenance.

Shadow figures all ceased activity and looked towards the chamber door. No staff were dispatched to replace the bulb, Chamber 52 sealed and abandoned for 30 days according to procedure.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-148Object Class: EuclidSpecial Containment Procedures:REVISION 3SCP-148 is to be stored as 120 cast ingots, each of which weighs approximately 10 kg at time of writing. Ingots of SCP-148 may not be housed at the same site as any SCP (due to the potential for unforeseen interactions); otherwise, said ingots should be distributed equally among acceptable Foundation facilities. The mass of each contained ingot of SCP-148 must be measured and reported monthly.Under no circumstances should any SCP with mind-affecting or extrasensory properties come into contact with SCP-148. In the event of such contact, the immediate area must be evacuated and the affected sample of SCP-148 detonated remotely.Personnel are not to be assigned to SCP-148 for a period of time longer than three weeks. Any personnel assigned to SCP-148 are to be given regular psychological evaluations.Description: SCP-148 is a metallic substance, composed of a variety of known and unknown elements. The total mass of SCP-148 on hand is approximately 1.1 1.2 tonnes. SCP-148 has a gray-green color with a bluish tinge and oxidizes readily in the presence of water. SCP-148 has a melting transition point of approximately 4500\u00b0C and a boiling transition point of approximately 9000\u00b0C. SCP-148 has a density of 6.20 g/cm3 6.76 g/cm3 and qualifies as HRC 39 in a Rockwell hardness test. It exhibits material properties, such as strength, ductility, and workability, similar to platinum.SCP-148 is composed primarily of platinum and iridium, the two composing 62% and 20% of its mass respectively. In addition, several other known metals are present in its composition, including iron, cobalt, and copper, which collectively make up 16.5% of SCP-148\u2019s mass. However, given the mass of the material, it is believed that there are other substances not detectable by mass spectrometry or other means. Images of SCP-148 taken with a scanning tunneling microscope show gaps in its lattice that, under normal circumstances, would be filled with other materials.SCP-148 blocks or otherwise hinders extrasensory mind-affecting properties of living organisms in proximity to it. This effect, while difficult to quantify, appears inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the subject to SCP-148\u2019s surface and directly proportional to the quantity of SCP-148 in consideration. The range for which this effect is detectable is roughly 0.8 meters per kilogram of SCP-148.1.1 tonnes of SCP-148 were retrieved from the metallurgical department of Prometheus Labs\u2019 base facility during the Foundation\u2019s sweep of the building. Documents concerned with the project had unveiled that the substance was to be subject to additional development, sold to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, trademarked, and sold as \u201cTelekill Alloy\u201d. However, due to [REDACTED] and its political fallout, along with the destruction of the Prometheus Labs\u2019 base facility, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has acquired an estimated 1.3 tonnes of SCP-148 and sold it to unknown buyers. Foundation agents and forensic accountants are in the process of tracking the remaining supplies of SCP-148.Addendum 148-01Due to its potential for use in containment of mind-affecting SCPs, SCP-148 has been approved for cross-testing with SCP objects. While tests are still in their early stages, tests with low-level anomalous items seem to indicate that SCP-148 will be an effective tool in containing said items. However, it does not appear to affect items whose notable properties are purely memetic.Addendum 148-02Beginning \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, staff reported irrational behavior and poor communication skills among janitorial staff tasked with regular maintenance of SCP-148\u2019s containment.1 After three weeks of increasingly abnormal behavior, two custodians were taken in for questioning and examination. Testing revealed that the aforementioned personnel were incapable of interpreting body language and did not appear to notice the intonation or phrasing of sentences. In addition, the affected subjects were incapable of determining the emotional state or intent of others and demonstrated severely limited vocabulary.Further testing has revealed that the language and communication skills of persons with regular contact or extended exposure to SCP-148 will, over time, deteriorate and disappear. It has been shown that, after eight weeks, affected subjects will be rendered completely mute and incapable of understanding or giving nonverbal requests, commands, or other statements, despite showing otherwise normal mental capacity.Addendum 148-03A measurement taken on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\u2588\u2588 months after the Foundation\u2019s acquisition of SCP-148) indicated that, despite no increase in volume, SCP-148 has increased in mass by 0.1 tonnes (a density increase of 9.0%). The source of this additional mass is unknown.Incident Report 148-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-1To test the limits of SCP-148\u2019s effects and its capacity to change in mass, 0.9 kg of it was placed on a scale and moved to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s chamber. Predictably, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s [REDACTED] was nullified by SCP-148\u2019s presence. However, the sample of SCP-148 began to grow in mass by upwards of 5 grams per second. After one minute, this rate began to decrease, and SCP-148 ceased to increase in mass forty seconds later, at which point it weighed 1.4 kilograms. It remained at this mass for eight seconds before plummeting to 0.8 kilograms in the space of two seconds. During this time, personnel within sixty meters (twelve times the effective range of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588) began to experience SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s effects, albeit at a vastly increased rate, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED] lockdown until the affected subjects could be removed.As of this incident, contact between SCP-148 and any mind-affecting items is strictly forbidden.Addendum 148-04Measurements taken since Incident 148-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-1 indicate that the combined mass of SCP-148 is increasing at a rate of [REDACTED]. It is speculated that should a large quantity of SCP-148 undergo an event similar to the sample used in Experiment 148-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [DATA EXPUNGED].

Incineration and irradiation measures will be deployed in the event of political or military action which may result in the facility being dismantled; a power failure; or zero communications from operatives or outside channels during any given eight hour period.The quarantine period for operatives leaving the facility is four months. If a breach has occurred, incineration and irradiation measures shall be deployed. It should be the policy of all G2 sites to not prepare an evacuation procedure.Description: SCP-008 is a complex prion, samples of which are stored in each of the known G2 sites. Research into SCP-008 is highly classified and primarily aimed at preventing research which may lead to the synthesis of SCP-008 in the distant future. Traits of the SCP-008 prion include:100% infectiousness.100% lethality.Transmission through exposed mucous membranes and all bodily fluids.Not airborne or waterborne.Symptoms of infection with SCP-008 manifest no more than three hours after exposure, and include:Flu-like symptoms with high fever, plus severe dementia in later stages.Coma onset approximately 20 hours after first symptoms appear and 12 hours after noticeable dementia. Coma onset will be considered onset of death.A period of sporadic cellular necrosis occurs which comes to resemble gangrene. Surviving tissue assumes its original function and is highly resilient.Red blood cells greatly increase oxygen storage capacity, resulting in slower blood flow and increased muscle endurance and strength.Nervous and muscular systems are unaffected by total organ failure for several hours.Metabolism may decrease to extremely low levels, allowing subject to survive for over 10 years without nutrition.High blood viscosity results in negligible blood flow from gunshot, puncture, and slashing injuries.Conditioned behavior, motor controls, and instinctive behavioral mechanisms are damaged, and cognitive abilities are severely retarded and erratic. Animals experience excessive brain necrosis and are inactive.Subject can adapt to its damaged nervous systems but is limited to basic physical activities, including standing up, balancing on two legs, walking, biting, grabbing, and crawling. Subject will energetically move towards sights, sounds, and smells it associates with living humans. Subject will attempt to ingest living humans if physical contact is made.Neutralizing fully-infected subjects requires significant cranial trauma.There is strong evidence to suggest SCP-008 itself did not form naturally on Earth, since variants of similar complexity would have displaced much of the ecosystem. In 1959, a short collaborative effort with the USSR to locate G2 sites and eliminate SCP-008 was negotiated following their discovery.

Object\u2019s chamber is to be fitted with temperature sensors which must be monitored at all times, and is to be kept refrigerated by no fewer than three (3) redundant cooling units. Any malfunction of sensors, or of coolant systems, is to be reported and repaired immediately. If at any time the temperature in the containment area climbs above -5\u00b0C, the chamber is to be locked down and flooded with coolant until temperatures return to safe levels (-30\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C).Containment area is to be kept in total vacuum during testing, and personnel interacting with SCP-009 must wear full environmental protection gear. Following testing, all equipment, personnel, and other materials must undergo dehydration procedures and be quarantined for no less than 12 hours. Any moisture found displaying properties of SCP-009 is to be quarantined and added to the containment area as soon as possible. Living organisms found to be contaminated by SCP-009 are to be terminated by chemical dessication and extracted molecules of SCP-009 added to containment.Description: SCP-009 is approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588 liters of a substance which superficially resembles distilled water (H2O), except with a distinct bright red hue. This red hue is discernible in all phases, and serves as the most expedient method of identifying contaminated matter before its anomalous properties manifest. In contrast to mundane water, SCP-009 assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100\u00b0C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam.Examinations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive. The substance appears to be identical to normal water molecules, with the exception of [REDACTED] in contrast to standard laws of enthalpy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Site \u2588\u2588\u2019s resident expert on Xenospatial Physics suggests that SCP-009 may originate in a universe with alternate physical laws.The most hazardous property of SCP-009, however, is its ability to contaminate normal H2O. When in contact with any aqueous solution, SCP-009 will, through unknown mechanisms, transfer its anomalous properties to other objects and creatures. Testing has shown it capable of assimilating ice, steam, tea, fruit juice, seawater, blood, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The time it takes for this process to occur varies depending on temperature and the exact chemical composition of affected matter, and had been observed as taking between 3 minutes and \u2588\u2588 hours.Experiments on D-Class personnel have illustrated the process of conversion by the substance, which has been found to follow a consistent pattern:Initial Exposure: Subject is exposed to SCP-009, and it begins assimilating any moisture present on the exposed surface. Creatures in this stage do not commonly notice any unusual symptoms except for a slight warming sensation.Surface Conversion: Frost begins to form on the exposed area as the heat produced by the subject and SCP-009 itself raises its temperature above 0\u00b0C. This stage can take anywhere from one (1) minute to \u2588 hours, during which time subjects begin to feel [REDACTED] crystals from the epidermis.Deep Tissue Conversion: Exponential increase in temperature of SCP-009 causes runaway reaction throughout subject\u2019s body, resulting in [REDACTED]. Actual blood loss is minimal due to ice crystals [REDACTED], allowing subjects to remain alive and conscious for up to \u2588\u2588 hours.[DATA EXPUNGED]Testing on D-Class personnel was discontinued as of 4/23/20\u2588\u2588.Addendum: Circumstances of Retrieval: Subject was found in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Alaska, on 11/05/19\u2588\u2588. The Foundation became involved after reports were obtained from the native \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Tribe, who came across the mangled bodies of a team of seal hunters which had apparently been ship-wrecked \u2588\u2588 kilometers from the village.All victims were found encased in red ice. Cause of death recorded as internal bleeding, though closer examination found [REDACTED]. It is surmised that the low ambient temperatures in the area retarded the freezing process. This prolonged the time to total conversion by \u2588\u2588 hours, and allowed the victims to remain conscious until [DATA EXPUNGED].Origin of SCP-009 is currently unknown. Investigation into similar events or materials in the area is ongoing. Evidence at the scene suggests [REDACTED], possibly involving SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.See Exploration Log A009-1 for details.Addendum: 11/09/19\u2588\u2588After initial report and retrieval of specimens, it was confirmed that the arachnoid entity found by MTF-B7 (see attached file) was indeed a previously unknown instance of SCP-3023. Investigation has revealed the instance originated in [REDACTED] as a result of [DATA EXPUNGED].Addendum: 12/06/19\u2588\u2588After repeated inquiries, it should be noted that the portion of coastline upon which the initial victims were found was barren rock approximately \u2588 meters from the seashore, and was sufficiently dry and cold to prevent significant contamination of the surrounding area. Had the site been closer to the water, there is little doubt an extinction-level event would have ensued.Consideration of upgrading SCP-009 to Keter class under review.Addendum: 12/16/20\u2588\u2588Super-cooling of SCP-009 for the purposes of experimentation is disallowed until further notice. Personnel are advised that liquid nitrogen is only to be used on the subject in controlled amounts, and only until temperatures have reached acceptable levels.Related note: Possible application of SCP-009 in cold fusion research pending evaluation.Memo from O-5 Command: 1/09/20\u2588\u2588We\u2019ve decided to keep this thing Euclid for now.

SCP-208 is to be housed in a 10 m x 10 m room decorated in traditional Egyptian style, furnished with a single couch and a stereo system stocked with music of North African origin of any era. Surveillance is to be maintained during all movement outside of containment. SCP-208 is approved to operate at Site-17\u2019s medical wing.Description: SCP-208 appears to be a short, stout man of Egyptian heritage, possessing a great deal of hair over much of his body. Along his brow is a mane similar to a lion\u2019s in shape and color, which grows down to a significant beard. SCP-208 typically wears an Egyptian tunic, similar to that of typical Old Kingdom military, although occasionally this is replaced by modern military fatigues.SCP-208 is capable of inducing rapid cellular regeneration and reconfiguration within organic life forms, which amounts to the ability to quickly and effectively heal most physical ailments. This is performed by a unique form of electromagnetic radiation released from SCP-208\u2019s body, which acts on a wavelength that oscillates with four degrees of freedom rather than three. The electromagnetic radiation displays unusual pulse phenomena. Furthermore, the energy of the radiation decays over distance in a fashion incompatible with the inverse-squared model. This radiation is emitted from SCP-208 naturally in small doses, and can be released in greater amounts when focused. Personnel have noted that being near SCP-208 provokes a feeling of wellness and ease, making him quite popular with the security staff. This radiation also possesses the ability of warding off ill intent, to the point of acting as a physical barrier to naturally malicious beings. What causes this is unknown, but MRI scanning of Class D personnel taken from death row in the presence of SCP-208 detected an unidentifiable pattern of neurons firing. This activity coincided with a feeling of extreme unease on behalf of the subject, as he tried to flee the secure containment chamber. It is speculated that the neural activity activates the acute stress response in human subjects, stimulating the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d instinct. What causes it to affect non-human subjects is still unknown.Despite his appearance, SCP-208 is jovial and friendly to staff, and enjoys the company of others. Due to his good behavior and willingness to cooperate, SCP-208 has been permitted access to most common areas within Site-17. Known to most staff as \u201cBes\u201d, SCP-208 has been adopted as an assistant in the medical wing of Site-17, a position he seems to have fit into naturally. SCP-208 is also fond of children, and has been noted to be very protective of what he considers the innocent. The only thing to inspire aggressive behavior from SCP-208 has been snakes, for which he has expressed a deep hatred.SCP-208 was originally discovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Egypt, during a search for SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 along the Nile River. While SCP agents began digging into sediment in the Nile Delta, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 spotted a foot sticking out of the river bed. Further excavation revealed that it was connected to a great block of granite. Recovered and brought to Sector-\u2588\u2588, SCP-208 was exhumed from the stone after surprising a researcher who discovered that he was still alive. After examination had been concluded, SCP-208 was moved to Site-17 as a Safe class SCP.Addendum 208-A: Comparison testing of SCP-500 showed that it still serves as a much more effective cure. SCP-208 commented that he still tells better jokes.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-427Object Class: Safe* (see containment procedures)Special Containment Procedures: SCP-427 displays no means of self-locomotion or malicious intent at this time, and requires only minimal containment. Due to SCP-427\u2019s adverse effects, only medical staff of Class 3 or above may handle or utilize it.All personnel using SCP-427 must record their total time using it in order to avoid unwanted mutations.*Instances of SCP-427-1 (colloquially referred to as \u201cFlesh Beasts\u201d) created by SCP-427 must be killed immediately as it is impossible to communicate with or experiment on them safely. For this reason instances of SCP-427-1 are classified as Keter.Description: SCP-427 is a small, spherical, ornately carved locket made of a polished silver material. The ornate carvings do not seem to serve any function; it is unknown whether SCP-427\u2019s outer casing was crafted by sentients or not. Its circumference at its widest point is roughly 3 cm.SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When opened, a small glowing orb is visible at the center. The orb emits no radiation or energy aside from the visible spectrum.When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections. As a standard of measure, the common cold takes 3 to 10 days to be worked through the human immune system and eventually removed. In the presence of an opened SCP-427, this time is reduced to 2 to 4 minutes. Its healing abilities are directional, so anything not in line of sight with the central orb experiences no effects.However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body\u2019s natural systems. Resistance to disease and toxins is increased by 500% compared to accepted LD50 or death-rate values after a total of 10 minutes of exposure, and 1000% after 15. After 15 minutes of exposure, muscular systems begin optimizing, increasing strength and pain tolerance by 200-300%. All other systems continue to optimize. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue. The conversion time accelerates with continued exposure to SCP-427.The \u201cFlesh Beasts\u201d (so named due to their appearance) created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with lethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry, but can be disabled with sufficient shock trauma or heat in excess of 1100 degrees Celsius (2000 degrees Fahrenheit). Intelligence cannot be accurately gauged, but mapping of biological enhancement of the brain as a direct relationship with optimization of other systems suggests intelligence could exceed levels measured in humans when fully transformed.SCP-427 is currently being used as a partial replacement for SCP-500 pills, as it can cure almost anything SCP-500 is able to. All \u201coptimizations\u201d imparted by SCP-427 are cumulative. Oversight has deemed the side effects an \u201cacceptable risk\u201d but users must carefully record their total exposure time as sufficient mutations are grounds for termination.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-253Object Class: EuclidSpecial Containment Procedures: At this time, SCP-253 poses a substantial threat to humanity. SCP-253 is to be kept under Biosafety Level-4 protocols at all times. All research is to be conducted at a site where incineration and irradiation protocols can be swiftly enacted, that is geographically isolated, and does not possess a diverse biosphere. The sterilization protocols shall be enacted following the occurrence of any event on this list:Communications blackout lasting longer than forty-eight (48) hours.Power disruption lasting longer than one (1) minute during any active experiments involving SCP-253.Abnormal rise in average temperatures beyond a change of 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) or rise in humidity levels to 90% relative humidity.Manifestations of unusual electromagnetic phenomena during testing of SCP-253.At the conclusion of testing, any subjects exposed to SCP-253 are to be disposed of, and their remains are subject to the sterilization protocol.Any researcher leaving the facility is to undergo two weeks of mandatory chemotherapy, followed by a 15-day quarantine.Description: SCP-253 is a cluster of undifferentiated human cells, matching the physiological traits of cancer. As per cancerous cells, cultured samples of SCP-253 will grow indefinitely if given an adequate source of nutrition. SCP-253 is contagious, able to pass from human to human, as well as to some animal species. SCP-253 is not an airborne contagion, but physical contact with surface neoplasms on infected subjects will spread the plague.The first sign of SCP-253 infection is the emergence of skin lesions, typically dime-sized (2 cm in diameter) in groups of three to five, at the site of infection. Within twelve (12) hours after the appearance of the lesions, MRI scans show the development of neoplasms within the brain. At this time, the neoplasms do not induce neurological symptoms.Over the next twenty-four to forty-eight (24 to 48) hours, numerous skin lesions start to emerge and grow in size. These lesions often induce substantial swelling in surrounding tissue, which can be quite painful for the subject. Often, the pain, if left untreated, leaves many subjects unable to move. Towards the end of the forty-eight (48) hour period, neoplasms start to emerge in the lymphatic system and neurological symptoms start to manifest.The neurological symptoms of SCP-253 are different for each patient, depending on which part of the brain the invasive cells have contaminated, with one exception. Each human patient heretofore exposed to SCP-253 has felt a complete cessation of pain forty-seven to forty-nine (47 to 49) hours after infection. Other neurological symptoms include:Inability to focus attentionDisorganized speechMemory lossHallucinationsEuphoriaMegalomaniaInappropriate emotional responsesSociopathyCatatoniaThe neoplasms do not seem to respond to radiation, and chemotherapy with high-dose mitoxantrone, irinotecan, and dacarbazine has only minimal effects. Chemotherapy was observed to kill some cells and markedly slow the growth of others, and therefore might be useful for post-exposure prophylaxis, but is ineffective in established disease.If the mass of cancerous cells within a population does not reach a biomass threshold of approximately one-thousand four-hundred kilograms (1400 kg/3100 lbs), the cells will overwhelm the host within five (5) days, resulting in death. If not transferred to a new host, the cancer cells will consume any remaining usable biomass of the host\u2019s corpse before finally running out of resources and dying.However, if the mass of cancer cells within a population reaches the threshold, electromagnetic phenomena will start to manifest. The sources of these phenomena appear to be the infected hosts, but the mechanism of the EM manipulation is not understood at this time.Furthermore, it appears the EM emanations facilitate some sort of communication between the hosts. Coordinated in some fashion by the neoplasms, the hosts start to act as one entity spread through many bodies. The intelligence of this entity is initially animalistic and reactive. As the intelligence of the gestalt entity is believed to be based on the remaining brain tissue within the hosts, it is hypothesized that the entity may be able to achieve human-like intelligence. The events from Incident I.J77.82 appear to support this hypothesis, and research suggests that some of the more unsettling things seen at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Hospital are manifestations of this intellect.Until suitable methods can be created to jam the EM transmissions of the end-stage infection entity, and until efficacious treatment alternatives for the diseases known as cancer enters common usage, the utmost care must be taken with samples of SCP-253.Addenda:253a: Proposal that SCP-253 be classified as Euclid is pending review of Incident I.J77.82 by the Overseers.253b: SCP-253 has been given provisional Euclid classification. Final report on Incident I.J77.82 has been released. Research into the events of Incident I.J77.82 has been approved.253c: Research involving approaching the threshold biomass in human subjects has been denied. Decision on request to test threshold biomass in cultured samples pending.253d: Use of SCP-500 in experiments with SCP-253 has been denied.253e: Use of SCP-427 in experiments with SCP-253 have been approved. Early results are not encouraging. Despite success using 427 to treat other forms of cancer, in this instance, 427 appears to induce accelerated growth in both tumorous growths as well as in the patient. Subjects were terminated as they neared the critical threshold for use with 427.

Performances of the play are associated with sudden psychotic and suicidal behavior among both observers and participants, as well as the manifestation of a mysterious figure, classified as SCP-701-1. Historical estimates place the number of lives claimed by the play at between \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 over the past three hundred years.Performances of The Hanged King\u2019s Tragedy do not always end with an outbreak. Of the \u2588\u2588 recorded performances, only \u2588\u2588 (36.78%) have ended in SCP-701 events. According to historical records and investigations, these outbreaks generally follow the same pattern:1 to 2 weeks (7 to 14 days) prior to Event: During the dress rehearsal period, cast members will begin to spontaneously deviate from the published text of the play. Rather than improvisation or gaffs associated with going \u2018off script,\u2019 said deviations will be both orderly and consistent, as if the actors were working off a new version of the script. The cast and production crew will seem unaware of any change, and \u2013 if it is brought to their attention \u2013 will state that the play has run that way from the beginning.2 to 3 hours prior to Event: The outbreak generally occurs during Opening Night, or else at the production with the greatest planned attendance (generally falling within the first week after the play\u2019s opening).1 to 2 hours before Event: SCP-701-1 begins to appear on stage in the final scene of Act I, generally in the background or to the side of the main action. It may seem to enter or exit the stage area, but does not appear to ever enter the backstage or off-stage area; it simply disappears when not on stage. The cast does not appear to notice or comment on SCP-701-1, at least at first.The Event: SCP-701-1 appears fully on stage during the banquet scene in Act V. Here, it will be incorporated into the action of the play as \u2018the Hanged King.\u2019 The cast will either murder each other or commit suicide, sometimes using items that seem to appear spontaneously on stage. Rioting breaks out in the audience, with viewers randomly attacking anyone in front of them, regardless of prior relationship.Following the Event: If any of the audience members survive the initial outbreak, they may exit the performance space, in which case they will continue to engage in random or opportunistic violence. Victims will generally require sedation or restraint in this scenario; normal personality will begin to return roughly 24 hours after the event. Surviving victims will generally exhibit signs consistent with a traumatic experience; some will have no recollection of the event. Others may be rendered permanently comatose or psychotic.For a typical case study of an outbreak, see Incident Report SCP-701-19\u2588\u2588-1, an analysis of the events leading up to the last uncontained SCP-701 event in 19\u2588\u2588, during a high school drama performance in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. For more information on the play\u2019s published text, see Document SCP-701-1640-B-1.In short, SCP-701 is a self-evolving memetic virus, transmitted through unknown means through the text of the play. Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has theorized that SCP-701 events may involve [EXPUNGED]. This hypothesis is consistent with a spike in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 levels detected via satellite in the vicinity of the 19\u2588\u2588 incident, indicating [EXPUNGED].Foundation agents are under standing orders to suppress any performance or publication of SCP-701 whenever found or detected. Despite our best efforts to the contrary, however, the play remains freely available online, sometimes under different titles. All attempts to detect or isolate the origin of these copies have failed. Suppression of the play\u2019s publication has generally been successful, with most copies of a 1971 scholarly edition destroyed before distribution. Nonetheless, copies of the 1965 trade paperback turn up with some regularity in both college and high school libraries. Agents are to obtain or otherwise destroy these items whenever possible.History: The first known publication of The Hanged King\u2019s Tragedy was as a quarto dated 1640. The play\u2019s author is not listed. The publisher, one William Cooke, disappeared from the historical record soon thereafter. Strangely, the text does not appear in the Stationers\u2019 Register.The first known SCP-701 event on record occurred in 18\u2588\u2588 during a performance of the play in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, USA.

Personnel entering must wear EVA spacesuits (with an MMU if necessary) and ensure that they do not move too close to any of the planetoids in orbit.

This system is restricted to the confines of a single large cell, originally intended for SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. The cell itself is now devoid of gravity and atmosphere, a state believed to be brought about by SCP-756\u2019s \u201cbirth.\u201dThe system\u2019s sun is approximately 68\u201370 cm in circumference, and is believed to be in the middle stages of its existence based on comparisons with archived footage. The planets orbiting it range in circumference from less than 7 cm to 28 cm.SCP-756 was first discovered on the body of Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 after he unexpectedly collapsed during a minor cell inspection in \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. For several hours beforehand, Mr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had been complaining of numerous painful boils on his back. Following his loss of consciousness, a cursory examination showed that these \u201cboils\u201d were actually minute fragments of rock protruding from his flesh.However, one boil positioned on the back of Mr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s neck appeared to be emitting intense heat, likely the reason for his collapse: according to instruments situated within the cell, the temperature of this boil climbed from 70\u00b0C to above 550\u00b0C. By then, all witnesses had fled the cell and sealed the airlock behind them, leaving Mr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s incendiary death to be recorded by the security camera.When it was ascertained that the heat emerging from the neck boil had stabilised and was not projecting further than two metres, personnel returned to the cell and found that the interior was now little more than a vacuum contained by reinforced concrete. The neck boil had become a new star, while the small rocky protrusions had begun to form simple planets. Since then, SCP-756 has remained under observation, with particular emphasis on the evolution of life in the system.However, it has been observed that both the astronomical bodies and any life forms that may evolve upon them experience time at an accelerated rate: within a year of SCP-756\u2019s formation, the volcanic surfaces of several planets had given way to oceans, a process that normally would take millions of years.Some years later, researchers observing Planet III noted the formation and collapse of an empire over the course of ten hours, estimated to measure at least a century in SCP-756\u2019s timespan.The planets themselves, based on the latest survey, are:Planet I: volcanic, and far too close to the sun to support life.Planet II: generally mountainous terrain, with a large population of apparent non-sapients.Planet III: mostly ocean dotted with islands of varying biome, presently inhabited by a sapient species of nomadic reptilians, with a religion based on ocean tides and the unexpected sight of Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s helmeted face in the night sky.Planet IV: primarily composed of [DATA EXPUNGED] broken only by what appear to be missile silos and military installations, many of them believed to be covering underground cities.Planet V: heavily populated, with many large settlements built around wildly varying terrains. Unlike IV, the inhabitants have not achieved space travel, and as a result, are currently at peace.Planet VI: equally hospitable until the events of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (see Incident Report SCP-756 A) and has since reverted to uninhabited wastelands.Addendum: Any personnel caught placing glow-in-the-dark stars on the walls of the cell will be reassigned to paperwork.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-919Object Class: SafeSpecial Containment Procedures: [REVISED] as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-919 is to be kept in a locked storage room with no windows and two armed guards at all times. All personnel to interact with SCP-919 must pass a psychological evaluation.Description: SCP-919 appears to be an ordinary, full length mirror in excellent condition.Once a living subject has been in front of SCP-919 for 15 seconds, the reflection breaks synchronization and begs for the subject not to leave. The reflection appears to be completely self-aware, and has shown to have access to all of the subject\u2019s memories. When the subject makes any move to leave, the reflection quickly becomes hysterical. Once the subject is no longer in a place where they can be reflected by SCP-919, the reflection screams and violently disintegrates. Repeated exposures to the same subject have shown that the reflection is cognizant of what happened to it before. Extended exposure to a subject has shown that the reflection has no need of sustenance, though this was detrimental to the subject\u2019s mental health.SCP-919 was discovered after an incident in the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The owner of SCP-919 had apparently died of dehydration. It is unclear as to when SCP-919 came into the owner\u2019s possession, or what caused it to become active, if it wasn\u2019t already. Local authorities were eager to get rid of SCP-919.While SCP-919 has proved invulnerable to damage, its effective range can be neutralized by merely covering it. This results in the immediate disintegration of any reflection that has broken synchronization.Multiple subjects being exposed to SCP-919 behave as expected. Each individual reflection breaks synchronization and disintegrates at the appropriate time. The use of additional mirrors has been shown to extend SCP-919\u2019s active range.Also worth note is that SCP-919 has no ability for memetic contamination. Its apparent control over individuals is entirely verbal persuasion.Addendum:The use of SCP-919 for interrogation purposes has been approved for authorized personnel.Exposing animals to SCP-919 produced identical results. Of note, 68% of animals showed strong aversion to being exposed to SCP-919. After initial exposure, all animals showed extreme aversion to being exposed to SCP-919.Transcript of Incident-919-016:It is at this point that Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 encounters Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 standing in front of SCP-919.Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Hey, where have you been?

Both cells are environmentally regulated and negatively pressurized, with walls constructed of reinforced concrete. Access to these cells is regulated by an outer decontamination chamber and inner gas-tight steel security doors. Observation windows are constructed of laminated ballistics glass 10 cm in thickness protected by a 100kV electrified mesh. Humidity is maintained at 100% at a temperature of 16\u00b0 C. Specimens are monitored at all times via infrared cameras. Level Four authorization is required to access SCP-939, their containment areas, or the observation chambers.SCP-939-101 is dismembered and stored in Cryogenic Preservation Tanks 939-101A to 939-101M within Bio-Research Area-12. Access to SCP-939-101 requires authorization by two Clearance Level 3 personnel, one of which must be present for all research and testing. The contents of only one (1) 939-101 tank may be accessed at any given time. Core temperature of SCP-939-101 tissues must be monitored while removed from cryogenic preservation; should core temperature exceed 10\u00b0 C, tissues are to be returned to their corresponding tank and all testing suspended for a period of seventy-two (72) hours. Barring core temperature exceeding 10\u00b0 C, research of SCP-939-101 tissues may continue as long as its ramblings and pleas for release may be tolerated.Containment cells should be cleaned biweekly. While this takes place, SCP-939 specimens will be transferred to the adjacent cell. During this time, the cell\u2019s door and observation window must be inspected for damage and repaired or replaced accordingly.Heavy sedation of all SCP-939 is required before any interaction, including transfer between cells and experimentation, may take place. See Document #939-TE4 for transfer and experimentation protocol.Level C Hazmat gear is to be worn by personnel during interactions with SCP-939 specimens and in any areas which SCP-939 have been known to inhabit. Afterward, standard decontamination procedures are to be observed by all personnel involved to ensure no secondary spread of amnestic agents occurs.Following Incident ABCA14-939-3, all non Class D personnel interacting with SCP-939 for any length of time are required to wear two (2) water-proof electronic pulse monitors for the duration of such interaction. These pulse monitors will transmit to a wireless monitoring system independent of a facility\u2019s main power grid, with at least one backup power system on standby. Should both an individual\u2019s pulse monitors flat-line or otherwise malfunction, the wearer will be presumed dead, personnel instructed to disregard all the wearer\u2019s subsequent vocalizations, and a breach of containment declared automatically. Security personnel responding to such a breach are likewise required to wear these pulse monitors.Additionally, all live SCP-939 must be implanted with subdermal tracking devices upon capture.Description: SCP-939 are endothermic, pack-based predators which display atrophy of various systems similar to troglobitic organisms. The skins of SCP-939 are highly permeable to moisture and translucent red, owing to a compound chemically similar to hemoglobin. SCP-939 average 2.2 meters tall standing upright and weigh an average of 250 kg, though weight is highly variable. Each of their four limbs end in three-fingered claws with a fourth, opposable digit, and are covered in setae which considerably augment climbing ability. Their heads are elongated, devoid of even vestigial eyes or eye sockets, and contain no brain casing. The jaws of SCP-939 are lined with red, faintly luminescent fang-like teeth, similar to those belonging to specimens of the genus Chauliodus, up to 6 cm in length, and encircled by heat-sensitive pit organs. Eye spots, sensitive to light and dark, run the length of their spined dorsal ridges. These spines may be up to 16 cm long and are believed to be sensitive to changes in air pressure and flow.SCP-939 do not possess many vital organ systems; central and peripheral nervous systems, circulatory system, and digestive tract are all absent. SCP-939\u2019s respiratory system is atrophied and serves no apparent purpose beyond spreading AMN-C227 (see below). SCP-939 have no apparent physiological need to feed, nor any way to digest consumed tissue. Ingested material typically accumulates in the respiratory system of SCP-939 and is regurgitated once the amount is sufficient to markedly inhibit its function. Despite the absence of many vital organ systems, SCP-939 are capable of bearing live young. See Addendum 10-16-1991.SCP-939\u2019s primary method of luring prey is the imitation of human speech in the voices of prior victims, though imitation of other species and active nocturnal hunts have been documented. SCP-939 vocalizations often imply significant distress; whether SCP-939 understand their vocalizations or are repeating previously heard phrases is the subject of ongoing study. How SCP-939 acquire voices is not currently understood; specimens have been documented imitating victims despite never hearing the victim speak. Analysis of SCP-939 vocalizations cannot distinguish between SCP-939 and samples of known victims' voices. The use of biometric voice-recognition security or identification systems at any installation housing SCP-939 is strongly discouraged for this reason. Prey is usually killed with a single bite to the cranium or neck; bite forces have been measured in excess of 35 MPa.SCP-939 exhale minute traces of an aerosolized Class C amnestic, designated AMN-C227. AMN-C227 causes temporary anterograde amnesia, inhibiting memory formation for the duration of exposure, plus an average of thirty (30) minutes. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless with an estimated ECt50 for inhalation of 0.0015mg\u2022min/m3. In well-ventilated or open air environments, risk of exposure to ECt50 is greatly reduced but not negligible. AMN-C227 is typically undetectable in the bloodstream sixty (60) minutes following cessation of exposure. Reported sensations of disorientation and mild hallucinations immediately following removal from environments saturated with the agent are similar to recreational use of numerous psychoactive substances and easily mistaken as such.Note 03-23-2005: This report pertains to morphology alpha. For information regarding morphology beta, see [REDACTED] Experiment Log 914, AMTF Nu-7 After Action Report \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [REDACTED]Addendum 11-14-1981: A log of radio traffic between capture teams during initial contact with SCP-939 is available here.Addendum 04-11-1982: Due to SCP-939\u2019s intense aversion to bright light, it has been deemed a minimal risk of escape. Standard fluorescent hallway lighting is sufficient to deter SCP-939-1 from leaving its darkened cell. See Addendum 09-20-1991.Addendum 06-29-1987: Preliminary research into AMN-C227 suggests potential for use as a general-purpose amnestic. Methods of mass-producing the agent, as well as possible adverse effects, are being investigated at Bio-Containment and Research Site-06.Addendum 10-03-1990: AMN-C227 has been approved for use as a Class C amnestic. Projected annual production at Bio-Research Area-12 by SCP-939 respiratory tissue cultures is expected to surpass three (3) liters.Addendum 09-20-1991: Containment of nine (9) SCP-939 specimens has been compromised following a \u201cSilent Night\u201d breach scenario at Bio-Containment and Research Site-06. Nearby civilian settlements have been evacuated on the pretense of a coming storm. Recovery teams have been deployed to the area.Addendum 10-16-1991: [REDACTED] In light of this, all interaction with SCP-939 from September 8th to October 7th in the Northern Hemisphere or March 6th to April 4th in the Southern Hemisphere is strictly forbidden. [REDACTED] No male specimens of SCP-939 have yet been identified [REDACTED] contain a Class B amnestic [REDACTED]Addendum 02-20-1992: Effective immediately, use of AMN-C227 as an amnestic is suspended indefinitely.

Habitat temperature will be maintained at 30\u00b0 C. Feeding is to take place weekly by personnel placing three (3) kg of iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa) into the containment chamber. Water is to be supplied by an automatic misting system which regulates humidity levels at 50%, both for water required by SCP-111 and to prevent fires. In event of SCP-111 specimens breeding, personnel are to collect all eggs and transport them to the Biological Studies Wing for freezing.Description: SCP-111 is an apparently artificial species of invertebrate vaguely resembling snails. Adult specimens of SCP-111 are approximately twenty (20) centimeters in length, twelve (12) centimeters in width, and fifteen (15) centimeters in height, although exact size differs slightly between specimens. SCP-111 specimens differ from ordinary snails in that they have a warm-blooded metabolism, complex eyes, small \u201chorns\u201d consisting of cartilage-ridged tentacles, apparently increased intelligence (personnel are requested to read Test Log \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for examples), and a complex vertebrate-type jaw structure; as well, specimens lay eggs possessing hardened shells.Most abnormally, SCP-111 specimens possess small hollow sacs below their lower jaws containing methane from digestive by-products. A series of [DATA EXPUNGED] along the inside of the trachea serves as a \u201clighter\u201d igniting stored methane as the specimen exhales, blowing a small jet of flame from its mouth. Said \u201cfire-breathing\u201d generally occurs in event of stress or anger, although is not apparently used deliberately for destruction but rather as a warning. This is presumably due to the limited size of methane sacs, which limits SCP-111 specimens in the amount of fire they can exhale at a time, and requiring both time and starch-rich food to refuel.SCP-111\u2019s behavior is inconsistent with that of ordinary snail species, including whistling and hooting vocalizations easily audible to humans, high intellect seen in such tests as [DATA EXPUNGED], and parents caring for their young. Hatchlings have been observed imprinting on their parents, other members of their own species, or researchers. This is presumed to be a deliberate trait based on Document 111-a, as it means that hatchlings imprint upon owners.History: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 a package containing twelve (12) SCP-111 eggs and Document 111-a was mailed to [DATA EXPUNGED], a Foundation front organization.

The items are not permitted to be moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel. Under no circumstances should any other component of SCP-004 be taken through SCP-004-1. The effects of doing so are as yet unknown, and the current cost of experimentation makes further research impractical. Should any of the objects contained within SCP-004-1 breach containment, or the facility be breached, the keys must be brought inside and the door closed prior to activation of Site 62\u2019s on-site warhead. Unauthorized removal of keys from the testing area is grounds for immediate termination.Level 1 clearance is required for basic access to SCP-004-1; Level 4 clearance is required for use of SCP-004-2 to -13.Description: SCP-004 consists of an old wooden barn door (SCP-004-1) and a set of twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13). The door itself is the entrance to an abandoned factory in [DATA EXPUNGED].Chronological History07/02/1949: A group of three juveniles trespassing on federal property near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 find the door. According to their testimony, they found a set of rusted keys in an iron lockbox and determined what door the keys unlock. The juveniles are taken into custody after they contact Sheriff \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 when one of their friends (SCP-004-CAS01) goes missing.07/03/1949: Local authorities find the severed right hand of SCP-004-CAS01 eight kilometers from SCP-004-1. Other parts of SCP-004-CAS01\u2019s body are found scattered as far as 32 km from the factory. Under interrogation, the apprehended juveniles tell authorities that upon opening the door with one of the keys, SCP-004-CAS01 was torn into several pieces, each of which disappeared. At this point, the SCP Foundation takes over the investigation.07/04/1949: SCP Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 obtains the keys from the local authorities to begin testing. Tests show that SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13 all fit into a single lock on the large barred door. 12 Class D personnel are assigned to test the effects of the door. Of the twelve test subjects each trying a different key to enter the room, only two survive. Opening the door with any key except SCP-004-7 or SCP-004-12 caused the test subjects to be torn apart in multiple directions; however, no dismembered parts were found until later. At the time of writing, only two parts of each subject have been recovered (with the exception of the subject using SCP-004-\u2588, whose pieces were scattered in close proximity). The others have, for all intents and purposes, vanished from existence.Of the two surviving subjects, only one (having used SCP-004-7) returned unharmed. The other came back in a near-catatonic state, able only to remove himself from the room and then collapse on the floor, and had to be restrained to prevent him from gouging out his eyes (see Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004). The subject using SCP-004-7 said that he had entered a large room, impossibly big for the size of the attached building. After his exit, SCP-004-1 was propped open and an armed squad of Level 3 personnel entered. The size of the room is impossible to measure and the door frame and the individuals in the room are the only part of the room that can be felt or illuminated.07/16/1949: The juvenile suspects and Sheriff \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are terminated.08/02/1949: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is declared a hazardous area \u201cdue to unexploded ordnance\u201d and fences erected in order to prevent civilian ingress. Tests to determine safety of exposure to environment behind SCP-004-1 begin.12/01/1950: Space-time anomalies resulting from exposure to SCP-004 are confirmed. Testing is suspended until further notice.07/02/19\u2588\u2588: The unaccounted-for remains of SCP-004-CAS01 appear unexpectedly outside SCP-004-1. Despite being killed decades before, the remains of SCP-004-CAS01 are not decomposed in any manner and are still warm to the touch. Blood remains uncoagulated. The remains are remanded for testing.07/04/19\u2588\u2588: The unaccounted-for remains of one of the twelve (12) original test subjects appear in similar manner to those of SCP-004-CAS01. The remains have been designated SCP-004-CAS02. Records suggest that both SCP-004-CAS01 and CAS02 used SCP-004-\u2588\u2588.03/21/1999: With the massive proliferation of nuclear weapons and World War III only \u2588\u2588 years away, construction has begun on a site inside SCP-004-1. The site is to stock supplies for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 person-days.04/21/1999: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has ordered the site inside SCP-004-1 to be expanded to include emergency storage for all mobile SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 specimens and a \u2588\u2588-petabyte database for the storage of all SCP data. The facility is now referred to as Site-62.09/25/2000: Site-62 is operational. Labs and containment units are complete and can contain the most dangerous specimens. Backup of the SCP database has begun.01/25/2001: Due to time anomalies (see \u201cSpace-Time Anomalies\u201d below), all personnel working at Site-62 are now required to reside on-site permanently. Families of personnel are to be informed that loved ones perished in an industrial accident. Cloned bodies have been prepared for funeral.08/14/2003: Massive power outage across Northeast United States and through Canada. Due to the initial failure of multiple SCP generators, Site-62 was without power for fifty-three (53) minutes. During those fifty-three (53) minutes, those on site were completely without any source of light. They reported \u201csensing\u201d creatures and people, although no abnormal entities could be seen or felt. Selected facility personnel were allowed to read \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Appendix A) and said the creatures \u201csensed\u201d were of humanoid size but otherwise similar to the massive green creature described.Space-Time AnomaliesSCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies. Personnel leaving the facility report losing time. Those who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several days, and records of work completed and supplies consumed support their claims. Other temporal anomalies involve SCP-004-2 through -13, especially the reappearance of SCP-004-CAS01 and SCP-004-CAS02 exactly \u2588\u2588 years after using SCP-004-\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies. Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7. Similarly, the 2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of existence within the same space that Site-62 occupies.Additional NotesTesting on SCP-004 reveals that ten of the keys open SCP-004-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics and topology are significantly different than those of our home dimension. Test subjects meeting these hostile conditions are torn apart, their body parts deposited in various locations, only three of which have been verified to be on Earth. Material deposited at two of these points appears immediately; material deposited at the third appears exactly \u2588\u2588 years into the future. The other seven locations are currently unknown.Current testing focuses on two avenues of research. The first is finding ways to survive SCP-004\u2019s hostile topologies. The second [DATA EXPUNGED] suggest that SCP-004-2 through -13 may open doors other than SCP-004-1.Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-12All Class D personnel using SCP-004-12 return in a catatonic state, unable to speak. Some may have enough energy left to try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have survived. Only one has regained speech, following long-term psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view. He reported innate fear and sudden recognition, \u201cas if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,\u201d and forced implantation of \u201cincomprehensible\u201d memories. Subject displays acute anterograde and retrograde amnesia.Appendix B: Additional InformationItem #: SCP-004-14Date of Discovery: 09/02/1950Origin of Object: Object was discovered elsewhere in factory area, in the previously undiscovered manager\u2019s office.Description: Object appears as a large, unvarnished wooden box. The box may be unlocked by the \u201csafe\u201d key, SCP-004-7, as well as five of the \u201cunsafe\u201d keys (see Document SCP-004-1).Upon unlocking SCP-004-14 with SCP-004-7, the box opens automatically on hinges. The volume of the space inside is precisely five times greater than the outer dimensions imply. Items placed within while the lid remains open do not affect the weight or any other properties of the box. When the lid is closed and locked, however, all items inside vanish irretrievably. Personnel locked inside the box are also irretrievable, although losing personnel in this fashion appears to affect significantly the dreams experienced by [DATA EXPUNGED].", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "https://genius.com/The-scp-foundation-scp-458-annotated", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-811Object Class: EuclidSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-811 should be kept in a climate-controlled, cylindrical glass enclosure, between ten (10) and twenty (20) (inclusive) metres in diameter, filled to a depth of no less than two and a half (2.5) metres on average with wetland soil and stagnant fresh water. It is to be furnished with a variety of aquatic plants from its native swamp in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as the remaining vegetation there has exhibited the adaptation to regrow quickly from injuries endured during contact with SCP-811 as long as the roots are undamaged. Logs of manageable size and additional humus-rich soil may be provided for good behavior.Water depth is not to exceed half a metre (0.5) at its lowest point. Height of the enclosure must be no less than five (5) metres above the highest soil point. Temperature is to be kept at 25\u00b0C, and humidity should be kept above 70%. There is to be a decontamination airlock chamber between the door into the enclosure and the door into the rest of the facility. Air that is ventilated into the enclosure should not be recirculated back into the rest of the facility under any circumstances. The methane resulting from SCP-811\u2019s normal interaction with its environment is not anomalous and may be bottled for use as fuel. No heated elements or open flames are permitted inside the enclosure.The enclosure must be tested daily for pH and microbe levels in both the soil and water, as well as for changes in chemical composition. Enclosure should be cleaned biweekly, preferably by D-class personnel. All discarded waste should be put in quarantine for analysis before disposal by standard biohazard protocol.Subject is to be given at least five (5) kg of live food 24 hours after its completion of its previous meal. Subject is not averse to preying on humans, and it is recommended that personnel not enter the enclosure if SCP-811 has not fed in over 16 hours.No invasive medical procedure may be performed on SCP-811 outside of emergency situations in which such a procedure is required to save the subject\u2019s life. Minimally invasive procedures require review and unanimous approval by SCP-811\u2019s assigned medical team and the current project head. See Document 811-b for a list of substances that may be administered as medication to SCP-811.All requests by the subject are to be reviewed by both an overseeing animal enrichment specialist and at least one Level 3 personnel before approval, and the review should not take more than 48 hours, unless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.While SCP-811 is not generally aggressive unless it feels hungry or threatened, all handling personnel are to be cautioned that it is still an opportunistic ambush predator, and safety precautions must still be taken to avoid possible injury or infection. All personnel entering the enclosure must wear full-body, non-organic biohazard suits and breath masks, and must be in groups of at least two. No personnel are to enter the enclosure if they have open wounds or sores anywhere on their body. Those suffering from asthma or other respiratory-affecting conditions are prohibited from entering the enclosure without a signed note from a physician with Level 4 security clearance.As far as research indicates, SCP-811 cannot cause serious injury to anyone properly wearing their biohazard suit. Anyone who removes any part of their biohazard suit while still in the enclosure, for any reason at all, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including reassignment to a project that would not be adversely affected by their status as an amputee.Description: SCP-811 is shaped similarly to a human female with disproportionally long and thin limbs and a slightly-bloated abdominal region. It is 171 cm tall, and weighs just under 47 kg due to its strange physiology (see Addendum 811-2 for details). Its skin has slight abrasive properties, and is a mottled green color that serves to camouflage it among the reeds in its natural habitat. Its sweat has been observed to act as a mild skin irritant. It has extremely oily black hair that has proven to be resistant to cleaning with conventional shampoos (See Addendum 811-1). It shows partial comprehension of human language, consistent with case studies of \u201cferal children\u201d that had been abandoned at a few years old, instead of as infants.The palmoplantar surfaces of SCP-811\u2019s skin constantly secrete a clear, green-tinted mucus with minor adhesive properties. This mucus does not appear to have any effect on SCP-811\u2019s own tissue, but any other organic matter that it comes into contact with begins to rapidly decompose, through processes not fully understood, reducing the matter into a slightly viscous black liquid.1 SCP-811 can then absorb said liquid through its skin and directly into its circulatory system. Tests have shown that SCP-811\u2019s entire circulatory system is filled with liquefied decaying matter. Biopsies taken from SCP-811 have shown the presence of anaerobic bacteria in all examined cells, which, due to the apparent lack of anything resembling functional red blood cells in the subject, are currently presumed to be what SCP-811 uses to metabolise the chemicals in its circulatory system.SCP-811 does not defecate or otherwise produce feces in the traditional sense, and entirely lacks a small or large intestine. Instead, cellular waste and substances SCP-811 is unable to metabolise collect in what is, anatomically speaking, its stomach. Within the stomach, enzymes and bacterial flora cause it to congeal into a grainy, tar-like substance that SCP-811 periodically voids by voluntary projectile regurgitation, a mechanism which it uses to hunt. It preferentially aims at the face or at any perceived open wounds on its target, then waits for the target to die of either immediate asphyxiation by blockage of the mouth and nose, or in a few days of multi-systemic failure resulting from aggressive bacterial infection. SCP-811\u2019s teeth did not seem to have any abnormal resistance to decay resulting from chronic exposure to the compounds and microflora in its waste (See Addendum 811-1).Prognosis for personnel who have had contact with SCP-811\u2019s waste through a mucous membrane or open wound is good if broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is begun in the first three hours, but then rapidly declines. Personnel who are D-Class or have gone 12 hours without getting treatment may request termination.Addendum 811-1: To date, SCP-811 has requested:Regular delivery of bovine prey (denied)That crocodilians be removed from its prey animal rotation (approved)The water be stocked with a variety of fish species from its native \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (denied)One (1) hair brush, made of 100% synthetic materials (approved)For 1 D-class personnel to, every other day, come in with a basin and showerhead to wash and condition its hair (approved); it has been noted that standard-strength hair shampoos do not adequately clean away the excessive oil in SCP-811\u2019s hair, and use of a formula with a higher proportion of stronger surfactants has been authorised.To be addressed by a two-syllable name that has been transliterated as \u201cA\u00e9\u201d, SCP-811 being illiterate, and thus not capable of choosing a spelling for itself (approved)2Relief from its chronic tooth pain. (approved); request was initially denied until a safe and effective method of administering general anesthesia to SCP-811 was discovered and a dental surgery plan devised. Tooth #47 (FDI two-digit notation) removed to test method and adjust for unpredicted special aftercare requirements. Remainder of SCP-811\u2019s teeth removed and overdenture implants installed in a second operation. SCP-811 supplied with complete dentures, to be repaired as needed.One (1) turtle in a hazmat suit for non-dietary purposes (denied); turtles accordingly removed from prey animal rotation. Possibility of placing a small turtle habitat in the observation area outside SCP-811\u2019s enclosure for enrichment under consideration.Addendum 811-2: Due to the fact that SCP-811 has lungs and teeth \u2014 despite having no apparent use for either \u2014 it was brought to Bio-Research Area-12\u2019s radiology lab for X-rays, to examine its internal structure. Results were inconclusive.Subsequent MRI testing has revealed that SCP-811 has a number of unusual glands and organs attached to its lymphatic system, which may assist in regulation of the viscosity and microbial flora of the material in its circulatory system. One such organ in the abdominal region appears to contain lighter-than-air gas. The possibility that SCP-811 was once [REDACTED] is being explored.Due to the impossibility of maintaining a sterile operating environment, limited understanding of SCP-811\u2019s biology, and difficulty in calculating the subject\u2019s mass, the risk of major complications or subject death has been deemed too high to authorise exploratory surgery.Interview Log 811-16Interviewers: Dr. Trebuchet, Junior Lab Assistant Wachtel[Dr. Trebuchet and Junior Lab Assistant Wachtel enter SCP-811\u2019s containment unit.

SCP-843-2 is to remain in an enclosed pen, with D-Class personnel entering every 12 hours to supply grain and water. Any instance of SCP-843-1 or SCP-843-2 in the wild are to be reported and destroyed.Description: SCP-843-1 appears to be a seed of Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean), painted white with black spots to resemble a typical Holstein cattle\u2019s coat. The original packaging for SCP-843-1 contained 5 of these seeds, as well as a piece of paper proclaiming the items within to be \u2018Cow Seeds\u2019. SCP-843-1 is itself harmless, though when planted within 5 days SCP-843-2 will manifest.SCP-843-2 is a creature similar to a typical Holstein cattle, save that it is composed entirely of an unknown plant matter. At first, SCP-843-2 is much like a young calf and is rooted to the soil it sprouted from. However, at anywhere between 5 and 10 days the calf will uproot itself and begin to grow at \u2588 times the rate of a normal calf. After uprooting, SCP-843-2 will grow increasingly aggressive.

It is currently theorized that [DATA EXPUNGED].SCP-843 was purchased on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in a rural town in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

A recovery team was sent to the location \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 provided, but found that the store had been the victim of a faulty electric system and had burnt to the ground. All records of transactions have proven to be inaccessible (as the store was cash only and had no computer based record of transactions). As such, Mobile Task Force Upsilon-2 (\u201cCattlewranglers\u201d) has been established, searching for and containing more instances of SCP-843-2.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-860Object Class: SafeSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-860 is to be contained in a small wooden box in a vault at Sector-\u2588\u2588. By itself, the object is inert, and no further containment procedures are needed.Description: SCP-860 is a dark blue key of unremarkable shape. At seemingly random intervals of time, a series of numbers, later found to be UTM coordinates, will appear on the key\u2019s blade. In the time SCP-860 has spent under containment, the numbers have changed three times, giving the coordinates for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Germany), \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (England), and Site-\u2588\u2588.SCP-860 can fit in any door lock that requires a key located in the area of the given coordinates, and will function identically to the correct key for that lock. SCP-860 only works on door locks, and only if they are attached to a door; it will not work on any other type of locking device.When SCP-860 is used to unlock and open a door, the door does not lead to its usual destination. Instead, it opens into a small forest clearing centered on an 80 cm wide footpath, designated SCP-860-1. Every observation of this grove has noted the presence of blue-colored mist.As soon as any person enters SCP-860-1, the door automatically closes. From inside SCP-860-1, the door appears attached to an infinite concrete wall, and is locked. No attempts to break the door from outside, with personnel inside SCP-860-1, have been successful. Attempts to break the door from inside SCP-860-1 have resulted in [REDACTED]. See Document 860-III for more details.The trail inside SCP-860-1 usually leads to another door attached to another infinite concrete wall. This second door leads to the normal destination room of the door on which SCP-860 was used.A number of other anomalous events have been reported by personnel conducting explorations of SCP-860-1. These are explained in more detail in Documents 860-I through 860-IV.Following the events of Exploration IV (described in Document 860-IV), only level 4 personnel may perform tests on SCP-860.Incident 860-\u2588\u2588-12: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588 days after Exploration IV, SCP-860 was found on Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s office table, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 m from its containment unit. The item\u2019s containment locker had not been opened. Video surveillance from \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 AM shows the key suddenly materializing on top of the table.

Subjects infected by SCP-156 are to be restrained and monitored for their own safety. From September 21st-March 21st, infected subjects should be kept within a secure storage unit unless the experiment\u2019s parameters indicate otherwise. Both storage facilities should be monitored by security camera. The termination and autopsy of D-Class Personnel assigned to SCP-156 should be delayed until after March 21st. No personnel are permitted to consume SCP-156 except D-class personnel unless approved by a level 3 staff member.Description: SCP-156 is a group of exactly 181 pomegranate arils. The number of instances of SCP-156 is constant. When one is ingested or destroyed, it is replaced instantaneously with a new one among the largest group of contiguous instances. Otherwise, the instances can be moved around freely. After leaving the group (i.e. after an instance is touching no other instance), the instance will spoil normally, after which a new instance will appear. When all instances are destroyed simultaneously, all 181 instances reappear randomly at the location of one of the destroyed arils. Attempts to measure the time between destruction of one instance and the appearance of a new one using high-speed cameras have so far failed.If SCP-156 is ingested between March 21st and September 20th, subjects display no signs of infection until noon of September 21st, when all vital processes abruptly cease. A similar effect is observed immediately when SCP-156 is ingested after September 21st. Despite being technically dead, postmortem examinations of subjects have been unable to discover a cause of death. Subjects appear to have been in perfect health, aside from any pre-existing conditions. While \u201cdead\u201d, subjects do not show any signs of decomposition though the bodies of many subjects begin displaying bruising and scarring consistent with torture. While the majority of subjects suffer these wounds, not all do, and no reliable formula has been discovered to predict which subjects will be affected. Infected subjects remain in this dormant state until noon of March 21st, when life processes restart. Subjects remember little of the intervening time period. While most subjects are entirely unaware that any time has passed since their apparent death, some claim to recall a pale white male face and a wilting pomegranate tree.Subjects continue to die and reanimate annually on September and March 21st, respectively, until killed by another cause. Reanimation only occurs from deaths caused by ingesting SCP-156.After undergoing a single death-reanimation cycle, subjects began displaying high levels of distress and paranoia as time approaches September 21st, even if they have not been made aware of the death-reanimation cycle. Furthermore, subjects will take extreme lengths to avoid taking any sort of risk or danger to their person, even if they had displayed risk-taking behaviors prior to ingesting SCP-156. Over the course of multiple death/reanimation cycles, these psychological symptoms become more pronounced. At the same time, physical symptoms during the dormant period increase in intensity for the subjects suffering from them. Eventually, physical wounds on subjects will begin to emulate burns and puncture wounds. Many subjects gain a phobia of dogs and dead plants after 3-5 reanimations. After several deaths caused by SCP-156, the ocular tissue undergoes necrosis in many subjects. This tissue does not reanimate with the rest of the body. Often, after ten or more reanimations, reanimation of bodily processes will occur but the subject will fail to regain consciousness, entering a comatose state. Death and reanimation continues annually even after subjects have reached this stage.SCP-156 came to the attention of the Foundation after an incident in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Greece, after \u2588\u2588 people died on September 21st, 19\u2588\u2588,without apparent cause. The Foundation became involved after locals reported the return of several of the dead who had been interred in above ground vaults the following spring. After questioning these subjects, all reported having attended a party at the house of one A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 K\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who had been buried and was found, asphyxiated in her coffin. SCP-156 was discovered within the house, fresh despite the intervening six months since the incident. Testing commenced on D-Class personnel on August \u2588\u2588, 19\u2588\u2588. D-E15624, the first test subject, died on September 2\u2588, 19\u2588\u2588, and was autopsied. No cause of death could be found. Subject was left under monitoring in storage. On March 2\u2588, 19\u2588\u2588, subject began to show brain activity and subject\u2019s heart began beating despite the body having taken significant damage during the autopsy. D-E15624 expired shortly thereafter without regaining consciousness. Arils given SCP status and longer term testing was ordered.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-165Object Class: KeterSpecial Containment Procedures: Housed in a facility at Armed Bio-Containment Area-14, SCP-165 is to be treated as a contagious, pathological organism. The highest sterilization and quarantine procedures are to be followed.Microwave field generators around SCP-165\u2019s area are in place to restrict movement of its dune within its containment area. Once every nine (9) days, SCP-165 is fed live cattle weighing at least seven hundred fifty (750) kilograms.Description: The organic component of SCP-165 resembles that of typical parasitic mites, seven hundred fifty (750) micrometers in length, with eight (8) legs and a genetic structure similar to the house dust mite. The main difference is the hermit-crab-like behavior of attaching grains of sand to its back. It is unknown what purpose the sand serves, but the massive colony of SCP-165 numbers in the hundreds of billions to possibly trillions, creating a rather large dune.The similarities between [DATA EXPUNGED] and SCP-165 are only superficial. [DATA EXPUNGED]\u2019s colony is protozoan in nature and apparently shows a collective intelligence and awareness that is not understood. SCP-165\u2019s colony is made up of individual Acari who don\u2019t show cooperation but rather competition in the hunt for food. Like mosquitoes, they rely on chemical detection of carbon dioxide and sugars in the air to detect prey. The Acari mites roll and bound over one another toward prey, only using their legs to climb over one another. When in contact with the flesh of animals, they release a numbing chemical toxin in their bite, similar in make-up to that of mosquito and flea bite toxins. Subjects are typically unaware that millions of mites are \u2018taking turns\u2019 at grabbing mouthfuls of its flesh as they swarm around their victim.A typical swarm resembles a swirling vortex around a victim or victim\u2019s appendage. The SCP-165 colony is efficient enough in their competitive swarming that most animals' appendages can be de-fleshed and reduced to bone within minutes. The numbing toxin is so effective that sleeping victims may not wake up as their limbs are eaten away.The Acari mites are resistant to all but the most dangerous of pesticides. They retreat from heat and will often seek shade when available, being the most active during the night, hunting for large sleeping prey. Their vulnerability to heat is the most preferable technique for containment.Addendum \u2013 Acquisition: It is apparent that the US Government has been aware of dunes of SCP-165 for some eighty (80) years. The area where SCP-165 was found is now a forgotten German immigrant ghost town of Fredricksburg, Arizona, in the Tule Desert near the Goldwater Air Force Bombing Range.The remote town of Fredricksburg was founded sometime in the late 1800s and by 1908 had become a ghost town. A passing cavalry troop reported that the inhabitants had disappeared and that the buildings were empty. They attempted to stay one night in the abandoned hotel, only to have seven (7) of their horses reduced to piles of bone. All but four (4) of the soldiers fled in the middle of the night, saying that sand was filling the building like a flood of water. Those four were never seen again.During the late 1950s, the U.S. military attempted to exterminate SCP-165 by turning the area into a bombing range. It was successful in reducing the numbers of SCP-165, but in the late 1980s, it became apparent that a ground cleanup and extraction was needed to remove the presence of SCP-165. Mobile Task-Force Epsilon-9 (aka \u201cFire Eaters\u201d) were dispatched for containment and extraction of SCP-165. Upon entering the town of Fredricksburg, an upturned sign was found, reading \u201cVorsicht vor dem kriechenden, hungrigen Sand\u201d which translates to \u201cBeware the creeping, hungry sands.\u201d The flame accelerators of MTF \u0190-9 proved highly successful in glassing the sand of SCP-165 and reducing its number to a manageable size. A living dune of nearly four (4) metric tons of SCP-165 was contained and transported to ABC Area-14 where it is monitored and contained.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-109Object Class: Euclid (See Addendum 109-1)Special Containment Procedures: SCP-109 is currently located in Non-Critical Storage Unit 7 and requires no active monitoring. It should not be removed from the unit except to be transported to a research facility, and then only by personnel with Level 3 security clearance or higher. When replacing SCP-109, personnel should ensure that it is firmly closed and that it is placed on the molded pedestal in the upright position.Description: SCP-109 is a standard-issue United States Army canteen (circa 1899) made of a tin alloy and fitted with a heavy cotton cover and a black leather strap. When opened, the item is seen to be nearly full of water. A seemingly unlimited amount of water can be removed from the container without changing the water level or the item\u2019s mass, which remains a constant 3.16 kg.

The water remains at a constant temperature of 19\u00b0C but can be heated or cooled when moved to another container.Addendum 109-1: Upon the item\u2019s delivery to Site-19, it was given the object class of Safe. As tests were conducted on the item, uncertainty surrounding test results prompted Gen. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to upgrade the object class to Euclid.Addendum 109-2: Recently, a request was filed and granted by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for permission to water an okra plant growing in his office with SCP-109. Staff should be notified that Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 uses SCP-109 for this purpose for a small time every Friday.Addendum 109-3: \u201cIt has come to my attention that new Class D personnel are often dared to empty the bottle. Guards are reminded that they are to discourage such activity, and inform them that SCP-109 is bottomless. Chanting \u2018Chug!\u2019 repeatedly is considered unprofessional.\u201d \u2014 Dr. KleinAdditional Information: Due to the range of tests conducted on SCP-109, this section has been provided to present test results in chronological order. Dates have been withheld for confidentiality.TEST 1: Subjects imbibed water from SCP-109, reported that it was very refreshing and, despite the metal content, very tasty. Urine samples from subjects were normal.TEST 2: Follow-up test to TEST 1 had subjects dehydrate themselves for 1 full day before imbibing water from SCP-109. Test remains unfinished as subjects were unable to provide urine samples.TEST 3: Subject bathed in water from SCP-109. Subject reported increased energy and a much improved complexion following the bath.TEST 4: Streptococcus bacteria cultured in water from SCP-109 thrived and multiplied quickly. Water from SCP-109 administered to subject suffering from streptococcal infection killed nearly all bacteria and produced a full recovery within 24 hours.TEST 5: Blood substitute created using water from SCP-109, given in transfusion to pedestrian hit by a drunk driver. Subject showed no malign symptoms from the transfusion and made a full recovery. Subject\u2019s physical therapy concluded six weeks early.TEST 6: Water from SCP-109 administered to various plant organisms, all of which remained very healthy and showed no malign symptoms.One proposition for a test which has been discussed for some time has been one involving a combination of SCP-109 and SCP-402. Due to the risk of losing one or both items or creating a hazardous situation, this test has never been conducted.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-051Object Class: SafeSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-051 and SCP-051-A are to be kept in a sealed containment facility. SCP-051-A is kept within a locked, climate-controlled document box with a viewing window, to prevent degradation of its material. Any personnel (with the exception of pregnant or non-sterile female personnel, who might not be aware of an early-stage pregnancy) may access SCP-051 as long as a request is placed before-hand and cleared by site administration.Description: SCP-051 is a 25 cm (10 in) anatomically correct model of a human female, carved out of ivory, with typically Asian features. Microscopic analysis shows that the head hair is human hair. The doll is jointed at the shoulders, hips, and knees. The \u2018stomach\u2019 area of the doll is fully removable as a \u2018cap\u2019 of ivory, exposing a detailed ribcage and organs, and a 2.5 cm (1 in) ivory fetus connected to the main figure by a leather cord umbilicus.When brought into the presence of a pregnant human female, SCP-051 has various deleterious effects upon the pregnancy, generally resulting in miscarriage of the fetus. Reports include a gentle compulsion to handle the model, open its stomach cap and take out the fetus. This results in nausea and cramping within 5 minutes, vaginal bleeding that begins as spotting and may progress to hemorrhage within the next half-hour, and miscarriage within 2 \u2013 24 hours in most recorded cases. Medical records indicate that the aborted fetuses bear moderate to severe defects. Pregnancies carried to term after exposure to the model have resulted in severely deformed live births, including \u2588\u2588 deaths of the mothers and \u2588\u2588 infants terminated after birth by the delivering physician (see interview 051-1 below). Witnesses to these live births showed signs of severe emotional trauma that was alleviated, after Foundation interviews, by administration of a Class A amnestic.SCP-051-A is a fragment of text on rice paper that was discovered with SCP-051. The surviving text is written with plant-derived ink test-dated to the 12th century, and the characters have been identified as a known early dialect of Japanese. Translation reveals the text is part of a prayer or spell against \u2018demons\u2019 that attack unborn babies. The incantation orders these forces or demons into the model, instead of a pregnant woman, and claims to trap them there. However, centuries have degraded the paper and ink so that the full incantation and instructions, if any, cannot be deciphered.Addendum: SCP-051 and SCP-051-A were discovered in a box of early Japanese artifacts delivered anonymously to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Museum in 1938.

The dimensions of the paper-like product should have no parallel borders, no right angles, and no side\u2019s length should be equal to any other (033-Safe dimensions). When contained in this manner, the paper-like product should be secured in a locked non-combination storage vault at least 30 meters from any computing or recording device. Logs for check-out or check-in of SCP-033 should be filled out at the minimum safe distance of 30 meters to avoid possible contamination of the paper product or electronic device the log is kept in.When removed for study, SCP-033 can be copied to a white/chalkboard with 033-Safe dimensions by Class D staff. Upon transfer to the white/chalkboard, the paper-like product that had contained SCP-033 should be incinerated. Observation and study should take place in a secured conference room at least 30 meters from any computing or recording device for the maximum 2560 second viewing window. All observations or notes should be made on 033-Safe materials. Under no circumstances should any notes regarding SCP-033 leave the storage facility or be input into a computing or recording device.At precisely 2000 seconds of viewing, research must stop and SCP-033 should be transferred to a new 033-Safe paper-like product and returned to storage by Class D staff. The white/chalkboard utilized in research must be incinerated as soon as possible after the transfer is complete, regardless of whether SCP-033 has faded \u201cnaturally\u201d from its surface at 2560 seconds.Whether 033-Safe procedures halt or merely slow the deleterious effects of SCP-033 is unknown. It is theorized the irregular borders and hand-crafting by mathematically unpredictable humans somehow disrupt the logic which allows SCP-033 to function.Description: SCP-033 appears as a field of complex mathematical symbols ranging from simple layman-identifiable representations to those only interpretable by highly-trained mathematicians. The \u201csum\u201d of the symbols is equal to a previously unknown integer (designated Theta Prime by Prof. Hutchinson) of intermediate value between \u2588 and \u2588.As all modern mathematical calculations are performed lacking the knowledge or use of SCP-033, its introduction into any system organized without it begins eroding the numerical and eventually structural integrity of said system. This effect extends to SCP-033\u2019s transfer to any paper-like (defined as paper, vellum, papyrus, canvas) surface not possessing 033-Safe dimensions or any computing or recording device it is input into. If inscribed on any other material, SCP-033 fades into unintelligibility in precisely 2560 seconds. In addition, SCP-033 has shown an ability to \u201cleap\u201d from an 033-Safe material to a manufactured or electronic material which it can destabilize in at least one (1) instance (Incident report 033-D), requiring the institution of a 30 meter safe distance for electronic devices and paper-like products without 033-Safe dimensions.There is currently no 033-Safe specification for electronic storage. \u2588 of the \u2588\u2588 operational research projects involving SCP-033 are dedicated to finding such a method for electronic storage. \u2588\u2588 operational research projects are dedicated to the application of SCP-033 as a neutralizing factor for potentially hostile, machine logic-based SCP objects. Clarifying commentary from Prof. Hutchinson follows for non-specialist staff in document 033-A. Effects may be reviewed in document 033-Q.Document 033-A: Debriefing of Prof. Hutchinson after first observation.[Transcript edited for clarity]Prof. Hutchinson : Every school child knows that 2 plus 2 is 4. The solid mathematical certainty of numerical order and value is the basis for all logic-based systems. We know that after 2 comes 3 and after 3 comes 4. What this formula proves is that we missed a number somewhere. Imagine if all our technology was based on the belief that after 4 came 6. We simply didn\u2019t know or conceive of 5. That is, in essence, what this formula proves\u2014we missed a number.Prof. Hutchinson : I can\u2019t tell you why the hand-crafted vellum works best. I can only surmise that it displaces mathematical predictability in two ways. One, the irregularity of the crafting process due to human error serves to eliminate any traces of regularity that would be found in a machine-created product. Two, the irregular borders seem to confuse it somehow, as if it gets locked up looking for a pattern to identify and use as an escape hatch. I\u2019ll tell you this, though, I don\u2019t think it should be left on anything longer than a few days. It will find a pattern eventually.Prof. Hutchinson : I don\u2019t think it \u201cdestroys\u201d anything. I think it tries integrating itself into our system and our system can\u2019t hold it. It\u2019s like trying to cram another book into a full bookshelf. If you get a hammer, you can get it in there, but the whole shelf bursts eventually. If it gets out into the internet, we will potentially experience a full IT infrastructure collapse within hours.Document 033-Q: Test results, Trial 033-Delta 5.SCP-033 inscribed onto a single sheet of standard eight point five (8.5) by eleven (11) inch manufactured white copy paper (hereafter X1).

Current goals are to generate a geometric model of the object\u2019s behavioral pattern and to observe any changes in this pattern due to location and soil composition. Certain sites in the Gobi Desert and Australian Outback, as well as a number of salt flats scattered around the globe, are under consideration for future testing. SCP-064\u2019s current location is classified to all personnel under security clearance Level 3. Once growth has stopped, field teams are to document the structure\u2019s size, shape and composition and remove the object for transport to a new site.Description: SCP-064 is a light brown earthenware brick composed primarily of silicon oxides and some organic matter. The object weighs 1.6 kg and measures some 10 cm x 6 cm x 20 cm. Its surface is smooth and flat, with some minor cosmetic chips. By and large, the object is visually similar to most solid bricks used in construction.When left lying on a flat expanse of soft earth, SCP-064 will begin to multiply through an unknown mechanism. Close observation reveals the appearance of an irregular lattice of silicon fibers in the shape of the original object, which then fills and solidifies with a soil-based mixture until it attains the proper mass. This process may be similar to mycelial propagation in fungi, with microscopic root structures \u2018mining\u2019 minerals from soil in the immediate vicinity. Under optimal conditions (soil composition at roughly 90% silicon dioxide [SiO2]), it takes approximately seventy minutes for one complete brick to appear.Given a large expanse of earth to work with, SCP-064 produces a highly complex but theoretically stable freestanding brick structure, including floors and ceilings. Past observations indicate that the structure could attain the shape of a twelve-pointed star, over 10km in diameter and of considerable height. However, this is speculative, as growth stops permanently once the structure contacts a significant obstacle, observed to include any solid object over 10 kg in mass. Structural integrity is very high, as bricks orient themselves to be as level as possible and fit together almost perfectly. Interestingly, the structure\u2019s growth is tailored to a specific set of cardinal directions, with SCP-064 always being the northernmost brick on the lowest level.SCP-064 must be attached for growth to occur. Once SCP-064 is removed, the structure begins to decay, and all secondary bricks crumble to dust at a rate roughly equal to their rate of appearance. Replacing the object within twenty minutes halts this decay and allows growth to continue; past this threshold, the process is irreversible.SCP-064 was found by chance in April of 20\u2588\u2588. During satellite observation of an elevated plateau in the Andes mountains, a camera operator noted that one structure was apparently growing. Extrapolating the object\u2019s approximate location from the structure\u2019s apparent direction of growth (which stopped during recovery), field teams located the object by differences in color between SCP-064 and its secondary bricks, which were high in iron oxides from the local soil.

According to the debrief, they found a sheet of metal which was emitting the whine, and the sound increased in pitch and volume as they neared a specific location. Digging in this area uncovered SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, at which point the metal sheet reverted to the \u201cinactive\u201d state of SCP-175.Addendum 175-13: On \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a D-class personnel who had been a professional architect prior to his conviction as a serial killer was instructed to bury a wooden box; the intended purpose of this experiment was to see what SCP-175 would look like when buried by an architect. When Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 looked at SCP-175, once the box was buried, he immediately screamed, dropped to his knees, clutching his head with both hands, dropping SCP-175 to the ground, luckily, face-down. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was standing by the side of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 during this experiment, reported a flickering mass of color and a sense of extreme nausea at a glimpse of SCP-175 before it drifted to the ground. He quickly dug up the box, in order to reset SCP-175. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 went into a coma after this incident, and intense psychological screening of the D-class subject revealed a well-hidden schizophrenia and sociopathy.

The cell is positioned at the bottom of a 40 m shaft to prevent staff members from coming into the proximity of SCP-114. The cell is accessible by a staircase restricted to emergency use only. Daily rations are provided to SCP-114 three times a day by means of a dumbwaiter. SCP-114 is also permitted to submit written requests to attending staff by the same means. To date, SCP-114 has been granted one Qur\u2019an (Arabic), one prayer rug, and one blank journal with pens.Research on SCP-114 is suspended until further notice. Elimination of SCP-114 is acceptable in the event of a multiple containment-breach crisis.Description: SCP-114 is a Pashtun woman of Afghani origin, approximately 40 years old and 160 cm tall. SCP-114 has the involuntary effect of fostering and escalating violent conflict between all individuals in her proximity. Subjects within ten to fifteen meters of SCP-114 become inconsolably aggressive at trivialities or points of little consequence, often to the degree of projecting hostile motives on others. Arguments generally arise between individuals after one to three minutes of exposure to SCP-114. The resulting arguments turn to violence in all cases.Notably, persons affected by the presence of SCP-114 will never exhibit hostility towards SCP-114 or attempt to inflict harm upon her. Subjects ordered to deliberately injure SCP-114 find themselves unable to do so. For relevant information, see Experiment Log 114-A.Communication with SCP-114 has only been possible through written notes or electronic means. Researchers have gleaned that SCP-114 is unaware of her effect on other people. She shows little to no response to exposure to violence, and seems to be under the impression that human beings are naturally aggressively hostile to each other.SCP-114 is consistently unresponsive and uncooperative with researchers, and appears to be acutely wary of human interaction. Due to the difficulty of communication with SCP-114, psychological evaluations have been speculative at best. Rudimentary assessments strongly suggest psychological trauma \u2013 combat stress reaction and/or compassion fatigue have been tentatively proposed.Document 114-a-898-12:Abridged eyewitness report from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a former soldier in the 40th Red Army, interviewed March 23, 1991.

It was a shit little village, but the Mujahideen put up a damn good fight. Eight of our men killed, fifteen wounded. One tank destroyed. It was dead cold, too. You think the Middle East is warm, but you go to the mountains in February, it is not so. Anyway, we were mopping up the area, going through the huts, looking for weapons caches and the like. It seemed like every doorstep had some old babushka weeping and tearing at her hair and clutching our knees. But at the end of the street was this one big hut, no babushka outside. Only there were trays of food left out, like an offering before the door. (\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 pauses for several seconds) So six of us go in to search. It was big and empty inside, dusty, and practically bare. Didn\u2019t look like anyone had been in there in a long time. But soon, we hear this soft whimpering, though, and look! \u2013 over in the corner there\u2019s a little girl, must be eight or nine, curled up and all alone. Piotyr\u2026 he was a big softie\u2026 he goes over, he bends down, puts out his hands, says \u2013 \u2018Come on, little one, it is okay, we won\u2019t hurt you.\u2019 But the girl won\u2019t budge. Then Piotyr stands up, all stiffly, and looks back at us funny. Konstantin walks over and puts a hand on his shoulder, tells him to leave the girl alone, laughing good naturedly. Piotyr gets all red-faced, like he\u2019s had a full bottle, and shouts \u2018Get your damn hand off my shoulder!\u2019 or something of the sort. He looks like a wild animal. We are all in surprise. And suddenly they are on the ground, and he\u2019s bashing Konstantin\u2019s face in with the butt of his rifle, screaming. It took three of us to pull him off, and by then Konstantin was dead\u2026.\u201d", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-115Object Class: SafeSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-115-1 is to be stored in the Secure Vehicles Storage Facility in Site-\u2588\u2588, where access is restricted unless accompanied by Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-115-2 is currently being kept in a secure drawer of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s desk. SCP-115 is not to be used without Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s explicit approval. Any site staff using SCP-115-2 must return it in a timely manner or face punitive measures. No other special containment procedures are required.Description: SCP-115-1 is a toy dump truck, with no identifying markers or labels to identify its original manufacturer. However, unlike regular toy dump trucks, SCP-115-1 weighs as much as the actual vehicle it represents, roughly 90 tons. It is currently unknown how the vehicle weighs this much, as analysis of SCP-115-1\u2019s composition reveals that it is made of the same commercial plastic commonly found in similar cheap-quality toys.SCP-115-1 is also capable of motorized movement and can function exactly like a normal dump truck, excepting the fact that it is several magnitudes smaller. It is controlled by SCP-115-2, which resembles a heavily modified RC car controller. SCP-115-2 can control SCP-115-1\u2019s movements despite the fact that SCP-115-1 lacks any kind of radio receiver or mechanical parts. SCP-115-2 does not work with any other radio controlled device, but otherwise functions exactly like a mundane radio controller, even requiring batteries to function properly.Testing has shown that in addition to its abnormal weight, SCP-115-1 also has a similar carrying capacity as its larger counterparts, being able to carry or tow roughly 120 tons of cargo. In addition, SCP-115-1 also apparently needs diesel fuel to run properly. There is a small port in its left side that allows fueling, though it stores and consumes as much fuel as a regular dump truck. How it consumes the diesel fuel, as well as where it is stored are issues currently under study.SCP-115-1 was originally found in a construction site in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, where workers attempted to move it, but found the task impossible due to the fact that SCP-115-1 weighs 90 tons. They were forced to use heavy machinery to finally move SCP-115-1 off the construction site and to a nearby town, where it became a local curiosity. Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 discovered SCP-115-1 and found SCP-115-2 at the same construction site. Class A amnestics were distributed among the townspeople in order to cover up SCP-115-1\u2019s existence.To anybody using SCP-115-1 for testing, I would like to remind you about Newton\u2019s Laws! Driving SCP-115-1 recklessly at high speeds is inviting disaster, and we\u2019ve already had to deal with several destroyed walls and equipment due to improper handling! -Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-224Object Class: EuclidSpecial Containment Procedures: Item SCP-224 is to be stored in a soundproof enclosure with acoustic destructive interference nodes. Nodes must be replaced on a weekly basis by remote means due to the erratic nature of SCP-224\u2019s effect; non Class-D personnel are not to enter the enclosure. Additionally, SCP-224\u2019s enclosure must be kept free from moisture to avoid rapid oxidation.In the event that the clock begins to chime, all personnel must evacuate the area, and the location should be secured following procedure Zeit 77.Description: SCP-224 is a wooden grandfather clock, accented with a black lacquer and gold leaf. Markings, remotely observed, date its origin at the end of the 19th century. Though internal examination of its components has been done, the density and construction of its gears make method of function impossible to interpret.The hands of the clock do not move with any known consistency, though the tendency seems to be generally clockwise. Additionally, chimes occur at non-regular intervals, ranging from approximately one minute to several months. To further complicate matters, the numbers on the clock also have a tendency to move and shift, though they generally retain ascending order.Each chime has an anomalous acoustic signature that causes a drastic localized temporal acceleration. People and objects in range of the sound begin to age. The amount of time is not consistent with the chimes, ranging from essentially inconsequential amounts to several years, though the amount aged during any single event is consistent for all objects within the field of effect.SCP-224 was originally found in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Antique Shop and purchased by Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as a gift for his wife. When brought home and wound, the anomalous properties were noticed, though not acted upon, both apparently considering the object broken. Their bodies were discovered in their collapsed house two days later, aged significantly. Foundation personnel monitoring \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 took interest, and SCP-224 was subsequently recovered. Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were unfortunately lost following exposure during transportation.Any instances of SCP-224 retaining any numeric pattern for an extended period should be reported to Dr. Simmons Dr. Locke. Failure to do so will result in suspension and possible demotion.Addendum SCP-224, Cataloged Incidents:Due to repeated errors on the part of the maintenance crews working on containment for SCP-224, Dr. Simmons insisted that the following report be spread among the onsite work crews to fully stress the importance of SCP-224\u2019s containment. After its circulation, it was added to the primary case file for historical purposes.Today, I had the pleasure of informing Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that he is to be given retirement pay and is free to leave active duty as of this evening. It was not initially approved by Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 until I explained the circumstances.Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who is the father of Alice \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and husband of Merilee \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, was walking past the SCP-224 containment facility on Friday, March 17, 198\u2588. He was reporting to his supervisor\u2019s office to deliver the final report on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, which he was instrumental in helping acquire. Because SCP-224\u2019s effect is so unpredictable, he had no way of knowing that the object had activated until the acoustic dampening equipment failed, leading to the collapse of the wall. At this time, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was exposed to seven iterations of SCP-224\u2019s effect.The first one saw him age into his mid-thirties. Those of you who have seen the video are aware that this wasn\u2019t a drastic change. However, by the second exposure, he was now well into his forties. There was significant graying of hair. By the third iteration, he was balding, and we estimate his age reached into the early sixties. By the fourth, his skin had noticeably wrinkled, with liver spots appearing in several places.By the sixth iteration, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 collapsed due to a broken hip, fracturing several ribs and his left arm. It was at this time that he lost control of his bowels and bladder. When the seventh iteration ended, containment had to be manually reestablished. At this time, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is estimated to be over a hundred years old.As a note, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 volunteered for termination and examination of SCP-224\u2019s effects, should the retirement pay he was now technically entitled to be rewarded to his family. I heartily thank Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for giving us this opportunity to study SCP-224\u2019s effect. I hope you\u2019ll remember in the future that, while some SCPs kill immediately, others do not. Others leave lingering effects that have ramifications for the people\u2014and the families of the people\u2014who are subjected to them.Dr. Rasmussen was down the hall from Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. He is now a thirty-five year old man in an elderly body. Assistant Researcher Jessup, who was pregnant when she was exposed in the same incident, died when her child was forced through her abdomen. Her son is a forty year old man with the mind of an infant. Dr. Quinn\u2019s undiagnosed case of bladder cancer consumed his entire abdomen in a matter of moments.Please keep these incidents in mind before failing to replace the \u201cperfectly fine\u201d acoustic nodes in the containment enclosure.Dr. J.

Knowledge of SCP-159 is restricted to those of Level-3 or higher, and access is restricted to Level-4 or higher. SCP-159 may not be used by any personnel except for extenuating circumstances. O5 command may order SCP-159 to be moved at any time that it becomes necessary to use SCP-159 to prevent a destructive scenario.In the event that SCP-159 is utilized in this way, it is to be powered by a dedicated high-efficiency generator and a spare supply of fuel is to be kept on hand. There is to be at least two personnel on standby during SCP-159\u2019s operation at all times.Description: SCP-159 has the appearance of a standard neon sign reading \u2018OPEN\u2019, of the style commonly found in small businesses. When SCP-159 is displayed through a window of a building, and deactivated by removing it from a standard power outlet1, the building will become impossible to enter by any means. The locking effect ceases immediately when SCP-159 is reattached to a power outlet. If SCP-159 is switched OFF and then removed from its power outlet, its effect will not activate.When SCP-159\u2019s locking effect is active, the structure which it is displayed within will become effectively indestructible from the outside. Building materials will withstand forces that would normally destroy them, up to and possibly surpassing moderate artillery bombardment. The affected structure will remain completely undamaged; testing has shown that protected structures will be unharmed by heat, hurricane-speed-winds, kinetic force, undermining, tunneling, explosive charges placed on the outside of the structure, electrical current, microwave, ultraviolet, X-Ray, neutron, and gamma radiation, and vehicular impact. Persons within a structure affected by SCP-159 may leave at any time, but may not re-enter until 159 is deactivated. The effect persists if windows, doors, and other portals are opened, with outside forces continuing to yield as if they were closed.Buildings affected by SCP-159 will continue to receive utilities such as running water and electricity; however, supplies will be strained of foreign materials and chemicals upon entering SCP-159\u2019s boundaries. Additionally, a buffering effect appears to prevent forces such as shockwaves and extremely high heat from penetrating the surface of the affected building. D-Class within the structure during artillery tests reported that the concussive forces rendered by test weaponry was greatly muted to the point that an open container of water did not react.If a piece of SCP-159\u2019s tubing expires, it may be replaced by a matching part. SCP-159\u2019s effect will manifest whether or not there is neon tubing installed. Personnel are to replace SCP-159\u2019s neon parts if they fail. SCP-159 will fail to activate if it is unplugged during a power outage.Footnotes1.

Object size, spectral signature, and temperature are constantly monitored both onsite and remotely from Site-98.The primary containment chamber is lined with heat conducting, radiation-resistant NANOPEEK GFV polymer tiles and evacuated of any atmosphere. Heat from the object is radiated into the surrounding rock. Should enclosure integrity become compromised, the emergency system will generate a low power argon plasma shield. This is projected to provide a minimum of 4 hours for onsite engineers to effect necessary repairs before the object breaches containment.In the contingency that stellar evolution proceeds ahead of projections and a nova event appears imminent, or if containment failure is otherwise unavoidable, any remaining project staff are authorized to initiate the Pituaq Protocol.Description: SCP-037 appears to be a star approximately 5 cm (2 in) in diameter, with a luminosity of about 1*10-12 times that of our sun and a surface temperature of about 5000 K (determined by UBVRI analysis). The origin of SCP-037 is unknown, however, analysis suggests that it shares many properties in common with a typical main sequence star, other than its anomalously small size. It is theorized to have entered the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere via the North Magnetic Pole.The object was discovered in 19\u2588\u2588 above the Beaufort Sea at approximately the North Magnetic Pole. Intense electromagnetic interference was reported by Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert, followed by an extremely bright object descending toward the ocean from the sky. The SCPS Guardian responded and discovered the object wavering in an erratic trajectory about 200 m above the surface of the water. Once containment procedures were devised it was transported to Site-32 for study.Containment and transport of SCP-037 have been achieved by the use of powerful electromagnets, to which the artifact aligns itself according to its own magnetic field. The primary challenge to containment thus far has been its powerful electromagnetic emissions, which are intense enough to be easily seen by the naked eye from high Earth orbit. Its current enclosure is located deep underground to prevent detection and to facilitate radiative cooling into the surrounding bedrock. In effect, the entire facility and the surrounding volume of the Earth\u2019s crust act as a massive heat sink.Addendum A: Over the past \u2588\u2588 years of study, the star has undergone a shift in emitted EM radiation, suggesting that it is undergoing stellar evolution at a vastly accelerated rate. If standard stellar models hold up, this will soon result in an increase in radius by a factor of 100 to 300 times, and a concomitant increase in radiated energy. Emergency containment contingencies are being studied for that eventuality. Further progression of the star\u2019s life cycle will likely terminate in a stellar nova, which is estimated to have a yield of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

On the north wall, an observation room is to be connected, overlooking the main room through a window with thick black-out curtains that release only when the door to the observation room is closed. No attempts should be made to remove SCP-080 from this enclosure at any time. No more than one (1) 7 W incandescent light bulb is to be illuminated in the main room at any time. Absolutely no devices capable of producing light should be brought into the room. Under no circumstances should anything be brought into SCP-080\u2019s containment room that has the ability to shroud, conceal, or otherwise hide SCP-080. Failure to adhere to this will result in disciplinary action.Description: It is unknown if SCP-080 has a physical mass or \u201cbody\u201d, as all attempts to interact with it physically have failed and have been met with adverse effects (see Experiment Log 080-2). Researchers and personnel have described seeing SCP-080 as various shadows and humanoid effigies, with the only common attribute being two smoking \u201ceyes\u201d. It has come to the attention of researchers that SCP-080 induces uncontrollable drowsiness upon anyone entering its chamber. After approximately 30 minutes, any person observing it will be forced into REM sleep and may suffer irreversible psychological damage. This effect occurs even if SCP-080 is being observed from a separate room (see Incident-080-1). If at any time SCP-080 finds a way to \u201chide\u201d itself (such as in a cupboard, under a bed, covered in a sheet, etc.), it will disappear entirely. Additionally, if any light enters SCP-080\u2019s containment room with a greater luminance than that produced by a standard children\u2019s night light, SCP-080 will instantly vanish. Both of these events are considered a containment breach and any personnel responsible for this will be severely reprimanded and possibly reassigned.

As he has had the most interaction with SCP-080 thus far, it has been theorized that SCP-080 is somehow capable of some type of memetic effect on nearby personnel, even if not being directly observed.Addendum 080-B: As of \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-20\u2588\u2588, following Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s recent suicide, all personnel located in SCP-080\u2019s sector are to keep \u201cdream journals\u201d and are to inform site psychologists if dreams became increasingly violent or nightmarish in nature.Addendum 080-C: All staff are reminded that the black-out curtains in the observation room will not release if the door is not closed and that exposure time should not exceed thirty (30) minutes for any reason (see Incident 080-1).Addendum 080-D: It has come to the attention of senior research staff that some researchers are unable to see SCP-080, and may be entirely immune to its effects. Any personnel that thinks they are incapable of perceiving SCP-080, please report to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for mandatory testing.Addendum 080-E: It has been suggested following Incident-080-1, that a class D personnel be \u201cfed\u201d to SCP-080 once per month in order to neutralize SCP-080\u2019s effect on the mental health of on-site personnel.

The researchers entered the observation room and the black-out curtains were released. Believing the room to be safely shielded from SCP-080\u2019s effects, as it had in the past, the researchers began observing SCP-080. Approximately 40 minutes after observation began, both researchers suddenly fell asleep. Upon their retrieval, [DATA EXPUNGED].(It should be noted that following this incident, all on-site personnel that had reported suffering nightmares and feelings of unease had a good night\u2019s sleep and were generally in a more pleasant mood the following day.)Note: All personnel are requested to stop referring to SCP-080 as \u201cThe Boogieman\u201d. \u2013 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Item #: SCP-299Object Class: KeterSpecial Containment Procedures: A 200-metre-wide forest of SCP-299 is to be contained in an underground biodome (Area-299) in the [REDACTED] desert. All other specimens encountered are to be incinerated. No plant life is to come into contact with SCP-299 outside of controlled testing. Areas infested by SCP-299 should be considered class-8 hazard zones, firebombed immediately, and monitored for four (4) weeks. Any further infestation is to be incinerated, as well as all wildlife present on the site.Description: SCP-299 is an arboriform organism characterised by black, sharp-pointed branches. Closer inspection reveals that each instance of SCP-299 is connected to neighbouring trees by its roots. Prolonged contact converts these neighboring trees into another instance of SCP-299; this is SCP-299\u2019s only known method of reproduction.Addendum 299-1: SCP-299 infection will result from prolonged contact with any material from SCP-299.Conversion time varies by the size of the infectee. Generally, after a few minutes of exposure, the infected plant begins to shed its leaves. Low branches shift downward to a height of 30 to 100 centimetres and taper to a point. High branches retain leaves and shift toward the top of the tree, forming a dense canopy and making overhead identification impossible.Addendum 299-2: Microscopic analysis of low branches reveals that these points are composed of the same material as the rest of infected plant, and are remarkably sharp. Direct contact with the point of a branch from SCP-299 is unadvised, as even a sliver of SCP-299 material embedded in skin is known to produce disastrous results (see Experiment Log 299-1).Vine-like tendrils grow upward from the roots of SCP-299, reaching heights of up to two (2) metres. These tendrils are prehensile and elastic; organic objects entering close proximity are violently seized, impaled upon the lower branches, and incorporated into the organism via gradual conversion on the molecular level.Specimens of SCP-299 release chemicals known to spread throughout the immediate area and cause heightened paranoia and aggression in most animals, including humans. Under the influence of these chemicals, groups of people tend to split up and wander the forest alone, making them more likely to pass through an infested area.Addendum 299-3: Examination of material harvested from SCP-299 reveals that the \u2018wood\u2019 is brittle and similar in composition to [DATA EXPUNGED]. A single cell of SCP-299 will retain its infectious nature and is capable of re-configuring an entire organism upon introduction.Experiment Log-299-1Item: Maple seedling (Acer saccharum) (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test Record:A sample of matter from SCP-299 is introduced to seedling. Over forty-five (45) minutes, the seedling is completely converted into a specimen of SCP-299, retaining its height and approximate size. Seedling incinerated.Item: Oak tree (Quercus alba) (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test RecordOak tree transplanted into containment area of SCP-299. Over three (3) hours, the tree is completely converted into a specimen of SCP-299, retaining its height and approximate size. Matter taken from new specimen is consistent with matter from neighbouring specimens.Item: Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test Record:A sample of matter from SCP-299 is introduced to sunflower. Over ten (10) minutes, the plant is completely converted into a specimen of SCP-299, retaining its height and size. The flower petals have blackened and tapered into spikes, consistent with SCP-299 spike branches. Tendrils are frail and incapable of grasping large objects. Specimen\u2019s trunk snapped upon introduction of researcher\u2019s foot. Remains incinerated.Item: European Grape Vine (Vitis vinifera), confined to pot and growing upward along a trellis. (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test Record:Sample of matter from SCP-299 introduced to grape vine. Subject converted within thirty (30) minutes. Subject detached from trellis and adopted prehensile nature of SCP-299 tendrils. Spike protrudes from rooted area.Item: Results of previous experiment, pig (Sus domestica) (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test Record:Pig introduced to testing area. Subject showed signs of agitation. Upon investigation of SCP-299, subject was violently seized and constricted, eventually suffocating before impalement upon a spike. Specimen was left in containment and observed for 3 days. Over that time, the mass of pig and tendril tissues were integrated into the main vine. Spikes grew from its base, the roots extended and tendrils grew from them, and branches grew from the top of the tree, sprouting buds and leaves. Specimen was incinerated.Notes:SCP-299 appears to not be limited to trees. Infected plants seem to react slightly differently, depending on their unique biology. All specimens, however, eventually become SCP-299 \u2018trees\u2019 if given time to grow and change form.Item: Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test Record[DATA EXPUNGED]Addendum 299-4O5 Command has requested that researchers refrain from experimentation with carnivorous plants.Item: Pig (Sus domestica) (x1)Researcher: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Test RecordMatter from SCP-299 injected into pig. Pig began squealing and moving uncontrollably, until it fell to the ground and convulsed. Upon expiration, fine rootlike hairs were observed to grow from the underside of the pig; the flesh of the pig underwent a transformation into SCP-299 material starting from point of injection. After two (2) hours, the pig was observed to have become another instance of SCP-299, complete with tendrils and leaves. Subject incinerated.Addendum 299-5: As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, the trees in Area-299 have begun deviating from the standard form of SCP-299, with several growing what appears to be white flowers up to two (2) meters from ground level. Following standard protocol, D-class personnel were sent in to determine if the new mutation was dangerous. Upon approaching the flowers, the petals unfurled into highly mobile tendrils which immediately ensnared the head of one of the D-Class before pulling him back to the tree. All personnel were immediately removed from the area and placed in a 48-hour quarantine.Subject was observed emerging from the treeline approximately five (5) hours after being ensnared, apparently unharmed. Subject was then put in a separate 48-hour quarantine in accordance to protocol. Subject protested vocally against the quarantine, stating that he \u201chad to see the sun\u201d. Ten (10) hours into the quarantine subject spontaneously lost consciousness and several branches of SCP-299 began growing from subject\u2019s head and torso. Subject was terminated and then incinerated along with the growths.Changes to the containment protocol to respond to this development are under review.", "autor_orig": "The SCP Foundation", "titulo_orig": "SCP Series", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Almost certainly a reference to Timur, a Mongul conquerer from the 14th century.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Germ ~ yeast; huhn ~chicken.", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Literally backdoor so arse and fart !", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Tomorrow +", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "H J & G / freedom of choice / tonight yesterday tomorrow Blue", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Buried, burned and drowned \u2013 a reference to a trinity ?", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "\u2018zemzen zemzen\u2019 occurs between \u2018deep: threatens\u2019 !", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "ge denotes the past particples in German.", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "marken \u2013 stamps: German.Shaun, is a briefdragger/postmen earlier in theis chapter.", "autor_orig": "James Joyce", "titulo_orig": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.6)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Chance.

According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets within Islam. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief.Muhammad was born approximately 570 CE in Mecca. He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father Abdullah was the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and he died a few months before Muhammad\u2019s birth. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that \u201cGod is One\u201d, that complete \u201csubmission\u201d to God is the right way of life, and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.Muhammad\u2019s followers were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists for 13 years. To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina later in 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.The revelations that Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim \u201cWord of God\u201d on which the religion is based.

known to identify with purple and blue colours but the more recent generations have been known to identify with red and black, although they no longer really rep any colours.The gangs roots can be traced back to the days of the \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC who were a Jamaican yardie gang who had been active in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Most of their members came from Harlesden and Stonebridge as well as other areas of northwest London such as Kilburn, Willesden, Neasden, Wembley and Kensal Green.They organised their activities from their main bases of \u201cStonebridge Community Centre\u201d, just off Hillside on Stonebridge estate and the \u201cElm Tree\u201d and \u201cPalm Shade\u201d pubs,in Harlesden. \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC were lead by \u201cnotorious\u201d Jamaican \u201cYardie\u201d gangsters which included figures including Winston \u201cEscobar\u201d Harris, Stephen \u201cBeamer\u201d Murray, Jermaine \u201cMy Lord\u201d Hamilton, Rudolf \u201cRudy\u201d King, Ricky \u201cDiney\u201d Sweeney, Dean \u201cBobby\u201d Roberts and Tyrone \u201cLofty\u201d Freckleton, the older brother of Church Road rapper \u201cNines\u201d and the deceased Church Road member Wayne \u201cZino\u201d Freckleton.Winston \u201cEscobar\u201d Harris had been arrested and charged multiple times for a plethora of drug offences in Queens, New York City, before he fled to London, settling in Harlesden.Other Jamaican drug dealers would join him, some directly from Jamaica and also others from the USA and formed the \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC around 1995.Some \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC members had close ties with \u2018Tottenham Mandem\u2019 / TMD particularly their infamous leader Mark Lambie.The \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC were known for the rivalry with \u2018Mus Luv Crew\u2019 / MLC from Kensal Green and part of the deadly conflict triangle which encompassed an area from Stonebridge, Harlesden, Willesden and Kensal Green between 1997 and 2004.From 1997/98 onwards and especially following the death of a LCC leader Rudolf \u201cRudy\u201d King, the \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC began to split.Rudolf \u201cRudy\u201d King was a leading member of the Church Road faction and was rumored to have been killed by a fellow \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC member.After his death the Church Road faction lead by both Dean \u201cBobby\u201d Roberts and Tyrone \u201cLofty\u201d Freckleton started to war with the \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC, which is what has caused the longstanding feud between Stonebridge and Church Road, which has since been inherited by the younger following generations from both areas since the early 2000s onwards.The break up of \u201cYardie\u201d gangs, such as \u2018Lock City Crew\u2019 / LCC lead to the creation of the present day gangs in North West London in the early 2000s, notably Stonebridge, Church Road, Press Road, St Raphs, Kensal Green, Chalkhill and Kingsbury.Lock City Crew / LCC members from Church Road who split from the gang went on to form \u2018Church Road Soldiers\u2019 / CRS in the late 1990s.The leading figures in the beginning of the gang included former \u2018Lock City\u2019 members like Dean \u2018Bobby\u2019 Roberts, as well as figures like Shakarr \u2018Cash\u2019 Anderson and Tyrone \u2018Lofty\u2019

(SE5), notably Lettsom, Glebe and Dog Kennel Hill estates.The gang have also been active on estates in Walworth (SE17) notably the Aylesbury estate as well as other Peckham estates around Queens road notably Cossall, Clifton and Wood Dene estates.The first generation of Peckham Boys during the 1970s and 1980s mainly took their names from local Peckham estates with names like \u2018Acorn Boys\u2019, \u2018North Peckham Boys\u2019, \u2018Yellow Brick Massive\u2019, \u2018Peckham Grove Boys\u2019, \u2018Night Jackyls\u2019 or the \u2018Outlaws Crew\u2019.The gangs had recruited their own younger generations who took on the same gang name preceded by the word Young or Younger such as \u2018Young North Peckham Boys\u2019 and \u2018Young Peckham Grove Boys\u2019.The following generation of gang members went on to take up different names during the 1990s, some were Jamaican or Black British, whilst others were African, mainly Nigerian.Although these gangs were often referred to collectively as the \u2018Peckham Boys\u2019 these gangs younger generations were more clearly distinguishable from one another as they took on new gang names and territories.The Peckham gangs of the 1990s had been the \u2018Firehouse Crew\u2019, \u2018Gloucester Boys\u2019, \u2018Spanglers\u2019, \u2018Sunrise Crew\u2019 and the \u2018Younger Peckham Boys\u2019, amongst others.By the

\u2018Younger Younger Peckham Boys\u2019 / YYPB and \u2018Peckham Kids\u2019 / PK.The Peckham Boys had continued to be affiliated with their predecessors in the \u2018Firehouse Crew\u2019 and

far more noticeable publicly from their efforts to become rappers.Many of the gang names across London doubled up as music crew names and YouTube and MySpace then became the social arenas to support

Boys\u2019 became SI / Shoot Instant while the \u2018Younger Younger Peckham Boys\u2019 became PYG / Peckham Young Gunners.At this time gang definers, and identity, became important and the \u2018Peckham Boys\u2019 began associating with the colour black wearing black bandanas and reference to Southwark as the \u201cBlack Borough\u201d, whilst \u2018Peckham Boys\u2019 gang became better

Angeles.The original Eastside Clanton neighborhood was founded in the early 1920s and by the 1970s, they formed five solid neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles.During the early 1970s, Clanton 3rd Hood stretched from Santa Monica Boulevard (north) to Beverly Boulevard (south) from Western (west) to Vermont (east).Lemon Grove Park on North Hobart and Lemon Grove became a popular hangout for many Clanteros from the third hood including Melrose and Kingsley.Many members lived on Clinton Avenue, Maplewood, Elmwood and Rosewood, north and south of Melrose.Members are frequented BJ\u2019s.The clickas from this neighborhood include the Dukes, Mobsters, Lemon Grove and Locos but most of the members of this neighborhood either matured out of the gang or went to prison.Because of low numbers, Mara Salvatrucha was able to establish themselves in this same section in strong numbers since the late 1980s and have since had a gang injunction imposed against them by the City of LA.On occasion, you will find Clanton graffiti south of this neighborhood between Western (west) and Normandie (east) from Beverly (south) to Melrose (north) indicating that the neighborhood is still active.

For example, Georgia Street, which runs right through the LA Live Complex was once a residential street with families from Clanton.The buiding 916 Georgia Street, which was built in 1912 is one of the last old residential structures remaining from this street.During the mid 1960s, new members attempted to start a click called Clanton 18th Street, which most Clanton 14 members rejected.This new identity created a division between Clanton 14 located east of Hoover Avenue and the new teenagers living west of Hoover.Rather than dropping the 18, these new members decided to drop Clanton, becoming a separate identity; \u201c18th Street\u201d.As a result of this split, 18th Street began to spread its influence in the Pico-Union area, and by the late 1970s, Clanton had lost half of its 1st westside neighborhood and by the early 1980s Clanton was losing it\u2019s influence in the Pico-Union area.During the 1970s, the apartment on 11th Street and Albany was a Clanton hangout commonly referred to as the White House.Today, the old Clanton neighborhood is occupied by two different 18th Street neighborhoods, Burlington Street Locos, Crazy Riders, The Orphans, Witmer Street, Rockwood and Wanderers.Even though the first hood of Clanton is now defunct, there are several veteranos still around from this old neighborhood.The gangs from this neighborhood included the Cutdowns, Midgets, Pee Wees, Pico Union Dukes and Tiny Locos.Clanton 4th hood in North Hollywood and Clanton Eastside hood of South Los Angeles still remain active.Other Clanton neighborhoods in Los Angeles:Eastside Clanton 14th Street: in the area from 14th Place and Central south to Santa Barbara Avenue (Martin Luther King Jr Blvd)Clanton 14th Street 2nd Hood: in the Mid City section of Los Angeles along Western Ave between Pico & 3rd Street.Clanton 14th Street 3rd Hood: in Hollywood around Normandie & Melrose.Clanton 14th Street 4th Hood: in the North Hollywood area in the San Fernando ValleyMembers:Rudy \u201cBig Chino\u201d (R.I.P)Big Country (R.I.P)Big Dragon (R.I.P)Ernie \u201cGato\u201d Guillen (R.I.P)Jimmy \u201cLobo\u201d Palacios (R.I.P)Big Lucky (R.I.P)La Negra (R.I.P)Corwin \u201cSloppy\u201d Elmore (R.I.P)BetoEddie BoyGoofyIndioPenguinTankToroSmiley", "autor_orig": "The Slang Dictionary", "titulo_orig": "C (Gangs)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Members:Melly Gz (Incarcerated)Psych Bike (Incacerated)Ziggy Zah (Incacerated)Nappy Blue", "autor_orig": "The Slang Dictionary", "titulo_orig": "C (Gangs)", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Mark Wahlberg\u2019s dick was merely a prosthetic one in Boogie Nights.

Since the very beginning of his reign (1936-1958) representatives of the nation, salmon fishermen, no n-union glaziers, military groups; worried relatives, and especially the Bishop of Yeslove, a sanguineous and saintly old man, had been doing their utmost to persuade him to give up his copious but sterile pleasures and take a wife. It was a matter not of morality but of succession. As in the case of some of his predecessors, rough alderkings who burned for boys, the clergy blandly ignored our young bachelor\u2019s pagan habits, but wanted him to do what an earlier and even more reluctant Charles had done: take a night off and lawfully engender an heir.He saw nineteen-year-old Disa for the first time on the festive night of July the 5th, 1947, at a masked ball in his uncle\u2019s palace. She had come in male dress, as a Tirolese boy, a little knock-kneed but brave and lovely, and afterwards he drove her and her cousins (two guardsmen disguised as flower-girls) in his divine new convertible through the streets to see the tremendous birthday illumination, and the fackeltanz in the park, and the fireworks, and the pale upturned faces. He procrastinated for almost two years but was set upon by inhumanly eloquent advisers, and finally gave in. On the eve of his wedding he prayed most of the night locked up all alone in the cold vastness of the Onhava cathedral. Smug alderkings looked at him from the ruby-and-amethyst windows. Never had he so fervently asked God for guidance and strength (see further my note to lines 433-434).After line 274 there is a false start in the draft:I like my name: Shade, Ombre, almost \u201cman\u201dIn Spanish\u2026One regrets that the poet did not pursue this theme \u2013 and spare his reader the embarrassing intimacies that follow.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Breathtaking auguries!During a field trip in their high-school days, Shade\u2019s heart is won by Sybil as they loaf recumbent on a patch of green.

Since this insect, much like the butterfly, undergoes in its lifecycle a transformation that culminates in breaking out of a protective case and taking flight, in doing this it serves as a symbol of the soul\u2019s departure of the body at the time of death.\u201cIt\u2019s companion piece, a gum-logged ant\u201d, is an ant that is inundated, as if waterlogged, by the oozy resin of the tree. Since \u201caunt\u201d and \u201cant\u201d are homonyms, this dead ant, which was prevented from moving just before it died, evokes the poet\u2019s dead aunt Maud, who suffered from paralysis in her dying days: \u201cWe saw the angry flush / And torsion of paralysis assail / Her noble cheek.\u201dWe have, then, symbols of paralysis, death, and an afterlife, all of which are encountered on a pine tree, and represent the poet\u2019s pining.It must be added\u2014perhaps at the risk of critical interference\u2014that amber\u2019s remarkable power of preservation suggests to me a likeness between gum, memory, and art, of which I think Nabokov must\u2019ve been aware when conceiving his poet\u2019s encounter with the gum-logged ant on the day of Maud\u2019s death. The gum, which now preserves the ant, shadows the resin of his memory, which now starts to enfold aunt Maud. Oozing down the bark of his mind, it drips and drips into gum-like couplets.In Shakespeare\u2019s Timon of Athens\u2014the same play from which Shade lifts the title of his poem, and the same play to which numerous allusions are made by Shade\u2019s Zemblan annotator\u2014the character of the poet says of his art-form: \u201cOur poesy is as a gum which oozes from whence \u2018tis nourished.\u201d That is, a poet\u2019s lines seem to emanate from the sources of their inspiration; and here, in Shade\u2019s autobiographical poem, we encounter one of the many instances of this general maxim.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Facing the Azure Sky Expired: A Summary of Shade\u2019s Final MomentsFrom the meandering amusements of this final canto, it is difficult to discern just what a grand finale of artistic accomplishment has been achieved by the arrival of its final lines. To fully appreciate Nabokov\u2019s triumph, the reader must glean information from all sections of this varied text and make connections crosswise. The resultant picture of Shade\u2019s final day, along with the central signs and symbols found throughout the poem, must all be allowed to intermingle in the mind before a clean elucidation of Nabokov\u2019s grand artistic achievements can be formulated.On the last afternoon of his tragic life, Shade brings to an end his final stanza, limning his immediate scenery as he sits musing in his backyard arbour. The all-spent sun sinks slowly behind the horizon; a last-cast ray \u201cattains Dr. Sutton\u2019s last two windowpanes.\u201d The neighbour\u2019s gardener, who is seen pushing a wheelbarrow up a lane of trees and shrubbery, is a young black man hired by our deranged commentator, Professor V. Botkin, to tend to the garden at the Goldsworth estate while he is renting it temporarily on a teaching assignment. Botkin himself has just returned from the campus, having passed on his drive the poet\u2019s wife who was on her way out to a club-meeting. As the gardener continues to work away, Shade accepts Botkin\u2019s invitation to the Goldsworth home, where, in honour of his just-finished poem, couplets shall be read out loud and Tokay shall be tippled. As they make their way over, the two men notice the same butterfly\u2014the Vanessa atalanta\u2014which moments ago \u201cwheels in the low sun, settles on the sand,\u201d now land on the poet\u2019s arm before fluttering off again, flashing its fire-like blacks and oranges as it circles round a laurel shrub. Finally reaching the Goldsworth lawn, they see an unfamiliar man standing on the porch ringing the doorbell. This man\u2014we later find out from police reports\u2014is Jack Grey (or Jacques D'argus), escapee from the Institute for the Criminally Insane, who has hitchhiked to the Goldsworth home to murder the judge responsible for his long-time incarceration. Spotting Shade on the lawn, he mistakes him for his adjudicator\u2014they look alike\u2014pulls out a pistol, and fires multiple shots until the gardener dashes over and delivers him a lusty blow with his spade, thereby knocking him to the ground and pistol-free. But the heroic act proves just too late, as the poet falls prone on the lawn, pierced by a fatal bullet, from whose perforation slowly emanates blood through his white cotton shirt. Moments later, as his future commentator has ducked away to stash the poem in a closet, the poet, now turned on his back, faces the azure sky expired.Coordinating Events and Making Ornaments of Accidents: Nabokov\u2019s Art in the Final SceneAuguries of DeathPenned within the penultimate minutes of the poet\u2019s life, these lines confirm an augury that long ago was orchestrated. As he recalls in the first canto, Shade had, after having just turned eleven, a momentous mental collapse consisting, first, of \u201ca sudden sunburst in my head,\u201d then a blackout, and then an out-of-body experience, precisely in that order. This occurred when, lying prone in his childhood home, he was observing a clock-work toy\u2014a two-dimensional tin representation of a black man pushing a wheelbarrow\u2014work its way across the floor, passing multiple chair-legs before disappearing under a bedframe. From the commentary we learn that Shade kept this toy in his possession throughout his entire life, explaining, to the commentator who saw it in his basement, that he kept it as \u201ca kind of memento mori.\u201d Surely, however, he could never have known that, soon after turning sixty-one, and moments before his final collapse\u2014that is, his death\u2014he would see the sun flash against two windowpanes, and a black man, who was \u201cpushing an empty barrow\u201d up a lane of trees, disappear behind a nearby hedge. Neither could he have known that, being shot through the heart by a fatal bullet, he would land to die face down on the ground, mirroring that same attitude in which he experienced his collapse in his childhood.The windowpanes reflecting the sun are \u201ctwo\u201d in number, perhaps because this nicely parallels the pair of eyes with which he experienced that \u201csunburst\u201d in his boyhood. Admittedly, that might be a stretch. What is certain, however, is that windowpanes symbolize death, and likely even killers, since, in the poem\u2019s opening metaphor, which is later repeated, a bird, to which the poet likens himself, is killed flying into a windowpane reflecting the azure sky. Moreover, Shade\u2019s killer, Jack Grey, is in Kinbote\u2019s fantasy \u201cJakob Gradus,\u201d a member of a group of violent extremists based out of a Zemblan glass factory! Might it be of further significance that the sun flashes against the windowpanes of Dr. Sutton\u2019s house, in particular? We have seen in the text that words are reversed or \u201ctwisted\u201d in ways that sometimes contain information\u2014as in \u201cJohn son [of] Doctor Samuel\u201d from \u201cDoctor Samuel Johnson\u201d, \u201cToilest\u201d from \u201cT.S. Eliot\u201d, \u201cEmblaze\u201d from Zembla, and \u201cHades\u201d from \u201cShade\u201d. And here we find that \u201cSutton,\u201d in reverse, is the phonetic equivalent of \u201cNotice\u201d! These observations, then, amount to overwhelming evidence that, moments before the poet is killed, the sun\u2019s flashing against two of Dr. Sutton\u2019s last two windowpanes is the enigmatic augury: This is a notice of Death! This is a notice of a killer!The gardener, we are told, \u201cadmitted afterwards to a strange premonition which made [him] interrupt [his] work as [he] noticed [Shade and Botkin] from the shrubbery walking toward the porch where stood [the pistol-bearing intruder].\u201d How magical! How magical to be symbolized in the all-clairvoyant daydreams of an unsuspecting child; how sublime it is for such phenomena to take place in this world; how uncanny for it to escape the notice of all its helpless denizens. It is all as if \u201cfireflies were making decodable signals on behalf of stranded spirits, or that a bat was writing a legible tale of torture in the bruised and branded sky.\u201dAuguries of EternityAfter Shade\u2019s observation of the sun\u2019s flash against old Dr. Sutton\u2019s last two windowpanes, and after his observation of the black gardener\u2019s pushing a wheelbarrow up a lane of trees, he next observes a butterfly\u2014one of the Vanessa atalanta variety\u2014\u201cwheel in the low sun, settle on the sand.\u201d This, indeed, is an augury of the eternal and the afterlife. First, when this observation is made, the setting sun\u2019s rays settle on the sand as if to highlight it, just as they had highlighted, moments ago, Dr. Sutton\u2019s last two windowpanes in an act of revelation. Second, the butterfly is described as wheeling above the sand before settling on it. This detail should recall something that Shade, in his boyhood, used to delight in: \u201cthe miracle of a lemniscate left upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires,\u201d described in the first canto. Even the choice of diction here, to \u201cwheel,\u201d is redolent of those bicycle tires, and suggests by association the exquisite lemniscate imprinted in the sand by them. Moreover, were a butterfly in flight to cut this symbol just above the sand, it would indeed have to \u201cwheel\u201d in the air in a figure-eight flight\u2014etching in our poet\u2019s lucid photographic memory an orange and black \u201campersand\u201d suggestive of the afterlife. As we have seen, this symbol is representative not only of the infinite, and therefore the eternal, but, in meteorological symbolism, it figures as the symbol for haze. This allows the poet to use the lemniscate to make references not only to his long obsession, the great beyond, but to his late and unfortunate daughter, Haze(l), whom he desperately hopes is now residing, \u201csomewhere,\u201d within that beyond. Finally, and most obviously, it is perfectly apt that a butterfly and not, say, a bird, should portend the afterlife, since the butterfly is, by nature, the result of a death in a previous form. This is precisely why the poet associates this insect with his daughter. We know from the text that Hazel suffered for being unsightly, and that, being ashamed and abandoned by a blind-date, she walked herself into a lake and drowned. As we have observed elsewhere, not only does her ugliness make apt the poet\u2019s comparison of his daughter to a \u201cwoolly caterpillar,\u201d but her particular method of suicide, and his hopes for her survival in the afterlife, especially do too. For, the caterpillar\u2019s self-induced metamorphosis is, in a sense, a kind of suicide, and the subsequent sucking in of fluids to fill the abdomen of the prenatal butterfly is, in this context, evocative of drowning. Wonderfully, that this stored fluid is preparatory for the subsequent filling of the wings so that the butterfly can take flight, is highly suggestive of the exalted fate of Hazel\u2019s soul in the afterlife.A Celebration of Eternal LinesSoon after \u2018wheeling\u2019 above the sun-splashed sand and highlighting eternity, the butterfly alights and \u201cshows its ink-blue wingtips flecked with white\u201d\u2014a description which associates the creature to the craft of writing. This is a lovely little preamble to what is suggested moments later, when the atalanta alights again, this time on the poet\u2019s sleeve\u2014his writing arm, perhaps\u2014then playfully takes off again to circle round a laurel shrub. Since the wreath of laurel was in ancient times conferred on a poet as a symbol of honour, this last act of the Vanessa atalanta can be taken as a celebration of the poet\u2019s final, and \u2018eternal\u2019, lines.I feel obliged to add, in passing, that this butterfly\u2019s prominent blacks and oranges make her, in the following metaphor, the potential counterpart to the burning scraps of index cards on which the poet wrote variants to his final stanzas. \u201cAs a rule,\u201d the commentator informs us,Shade destroyed drafts the moment he ceased to need them: well do I recall seeing him from my porch, on a brilliant morning, burning a whole stack of them in the pale fire of the incinerator before which he stood with bent head like an official mourner among the wind-borne black butterflies of that backyard auto-da-fe.Those charcoal-black, wind-borne scraps fluttering in tow and tumbling\u2026. So distinctly do I see their orange edges scintillate, with quiet sparks, against the air that smokes and blows them.The Vitreous Reflections of a Cerulean SkyAs we have explained, the azure is, in the opening metaphor, a symbol of the world beyond, and, more generally, of anything that seems beyond one\u2019s reach. Hours before her suicide, the poet\u2019s young unsightly daughter is abandoned by her blind-date, just steps before the bar in which their date was to take place. Romance being her great beyond, she \u201cstood before the azure entrance,\u201d through which she never ventured, jilted and ashamed. In the opening metaphor, the waxwing is killed crashing into a windowpane reflecting an \u201cazure\u201d sky. Ever seeking the world beyond, which might offer an afterlife, the poet likened himself to the waxwing. He differentiated himself on the grounds that, whereas the bird, in its striving, died, he \u201clived on, flew on in the reflected sky\u201d, having had a vision of the great beyond when his heart stopped momentarily due to a strange, unfatal heart-attack. It is breathtaking, then, that, moments after being shot and killed, \u201cthe poor poet had now been turned over and lay with open dead eyes directed up at the sunny evening azure.\u201d This is all remarkable for at least three reasons: First, by taking this supine attitude, his eyes, even in death, are made to look toward that azure about which he obsessed all his life. Second, having been killed due to a resemblance he bore to the killer\u2019s intended target, the comparison between himself and the waxwing now gains an almost literal meaning: for now it is true that he and the bird are both killed due to a false resemblance, the one because a reflection resembled the sky, the other because he resembled an assassin\u2019s target. Third, this gives much depth to Kinbote\u2019s later insistence that \u201cthere remained to be written only one line of the poem (namely verse 1000) which would have been identical to line 1[.]\u201d If this is right, the last five lines of the poem should read:And through the flowing shade and ebbing lightA man unheedful of the butterfly\u2014Some neighbour\u2019s gardener, I guess\u2014goes byTrundling an empty barrow up the lane.I was the shadow of the waxwing slain.This suggestion provides the final lines with a perfect, rhyming denouement, since it caps them off by alluding to the death that they have been foreshadowing.Line 999 is an Old Friend of MineBut could it be that the abrupt stoppage\u2014at \u201cTrundling an empty barrow up the lane\u201d\u2014was itself yet another augury? Was it to parallel the abrupt end of the very life that the poem was recounting? It seems to me that something of the sort is suggested, not only by the poem\u2019s coming to an abrupt end, but also by ending on the particular line that it does. For, by ending at line 999, it seems to make an oblique reference to The Nature of Electricity, a poem published by the same poet, roughly a year before his death, in a publication called The Beau and the Butterfly. In that poem, Shade ponders whether the souls of the dead exist as electric currents:The Dead, the gentle dead\u2014who knows?\u2014In tungsten filaments abide,And on my bedside table glowsAnother man\u2019s departed bride.(The bride might be the poet\u2019s late daughter\u2014a reference which would\u2019ve been private between the poet and his wife. Recall that Hazel played \u201cMother Time\u201d in her school play, and that the watchman who discovered her floating body on the night of her suicide was described by Shade as \u201cFather Time\u201d\u2014who, unfortunately, \u201ccame too late.\u201d If, then, Father and Mother Time are man and wife, Shade, in The Nature of Electricity, could well be imagining his poor dead girl, from within the filament of his bedside lamp, keeping him company and illumined.)And maybe Shakespeare floods a wholeTown with innumerable lights,And Shelley\u2019s incandescent soulLures the pale moths of starless nights.Streetlamps are numbered, and maybeNumber nine-hundred-ninety-nine(So brightly beaming through a treeSo green) is an old friend of mine.To repeat, Shade abruptly left off the writing of Pale Fire at line 999, without completing a rhyming couplet. That line, written moments before his death, makes reference to the actions of a nearby gardener, which reveal this man to be the counterpart to that clockwork toy that Shade kept, since his childhood, \u201cas a kind of memento mori.\u201d It seems, then, that this much-earlier description of a streetlamp numbered 999, the electricity of which is imagined to be \u201can old friend\u201d of the poet, is an enigmatic augury of \u201ca friend\u201d who will be referenced in a line numbered 999, a year to come! The gardener is a \u201cfriend\u201d because, moments after he is seen, he will try\u2014alas in vain\u2014to save the poet from being killed; and he is an \u201cold\u201d friend for being the counterpart to that clockwork toy that Shade has kept, since his childhood. Even the description of this streetlamp, \u201cso brightly beaming through a tree so green,\u201d draws us closer to that clockwork toy, which, moments before his childhood collapse, the poet saw \u201cbypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed,\u201d and closer still to that gardener who, moments before the poet\u2019s death, is bypassing shrubbery and trees.Nabokov\u2019s Work from the \u201cInvolute Abode\u201dOf course, although Shade could have fabricated all of those parallels and auguries that pertained to the death of his aunt, his marriage, and his daughter\u2019s death, the same could not be true with respect to those parallels that pertained to his own death, since he could not have foreknown the particulars of his own end. The gardener and the clockwork toy; the sunshine flashing the windowpanes; the butterfly wheeling above the sand and circling round a laurel shrub; the reference of a previous poem to Pale Fire\u2019s line 999; all of these \u201caccidents,\u201d and more, are made into \u201cornaments,\u201d and beg for a cogent explanation. But, until strong textual evidence is amassed to show otherwise, the author or source of these orchestrations has to be Nabokov. Of course, for this assertion to be at all substantial and interesting, it cannot be meant in the trivial sense in which all authors orchestrate their own fictions. Rather, it is made non-trivial by the fact that the hero of this fictional world has himself caught onto his world\u2019s artistic parallels and coincidences, and has conjectured for their source artistic beings who dwell in a realm entirely beyond his own\u2014some \u201cinvolute abode\u201d\u2014from which they busy themselves \u201cplaying a game of worlds [\u2026] making ornaments of accidents and possibilities\u201d out of the stuff of his own world. Put differently, the protagonist has caught onto some of his world\u2019s artistic parallels and coincidences, on the basis of which he has conjectured transcendent beings who, for their own aesthetic \u201cpleasure,\u201d orchestrate those parallels into \u201cplexed artistry.\u201d To be sure, it is an insane conjecture, born out of prolonged despair and suffering. Nevertheless, from our vantage point, we can see that it is true, for it is the literary artists of our world\u2014Nabokov and his compeers\u2014who satisfy this conjecture best.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "The ampersand is, of course, the symbol \u201c&\u201d, which is representative of the word \u201cand\u201d.To liken the shape of a dropped rubber band to an ampersand is, we must admit, only a little amusing; but our amusement is elevated to artistic appreciation when we realize that this symbol is, in turn, a sort of lemniscate. As has been explained above, the lemniscate is a sidewise figure-eight, the mathematical symbol for infinity, and the meteorological symbol for haze, by which it has come in this poem to serve as the symbol for eternity, and the poet\u2019s dead daughter, Hazel.Ever since his experience of a visionary mental collapse in his childhood, Shade has been obsessed with questions of the great beyond, eternity, and the afterlife. He recalls, in the first canto, his boyhood delight at noticing \u201ca lemniscate left upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires.\u201d He falls in love with his wife during a school outing \u201cin April\u2019s haze,\u201d and names their first child \u201cHazel\u201d. His obsession with the great beyond comes to be felt with more urgency upon the death of his daughter, who suffered for lacking physical graces and eventually committed suicide. It is for these reasons, I think, that the poet likens his daughter\u2019s life to a \u201cwoolly caterpillar,\u201d which, after all, by a self-induced death, enjoys a second life in the beautiful form of a butterfly. In this light, it may dawn on the reader that the symbol for Hazel\u2014the lemniscate\u2014might also pass for a linear image of a butterfly, seen from either ventral or dorsal view. Moreover, it might likewise pass for an hourglass, an item which Shade is alluding to in his observation that,A thousand years ago five minutes wereEqual to forty ounces of fine sand.It is sand that drops through an hourglass to count the passing of time; the poet delights in seeing, as a child, a lemniscate left upon wet sand; and, on his final day, the poet will see a flying butterfly which \u201cwheels in the low sun [and] settles on the sand.\u201dShade\u2019s commentator will later recall that, moments before the poet\u2019s death, as they made their way to be indoors to celebrate the completion of the poem,With an inward leap of exultation I relieved him of the large envelope that hampered his movements as he descended the steps of the porch, sideways, like a hesitating infant.

[\u2026] In the large envelope I carried I could feel the hard-cornered, rubberbanded batches of index cards [on which the poem was written.]The poem\u2019s central themes are the great beyond and the death of Hazel, and all this now seems symbolized by the author\u2019s using a rubber band to hold together those index cards\u2014a rubberband, \u201cwhich always forms, when dropped, an ampersand.\u201dI picture an infinite hourglass as an ampersand\u2026 ampersand\u2026 ambersand? \u2026 amber sand\u2026 grain of sand\u2026 drop the sand\u2026 and drop the sand\u2026 and drop the sand\u2026 and drop the sand\u2026.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "A lovely continuation of the pun on \u201cChapman\u201d above, where the direct reference was to a Chapman of baseball who crushed a \u2018homer,\u2019 and the indirect to a Chapman of poetry who translated Homer.Soon after this pun, we learn that the poet, in his boyhood, \u201cnever bounced a ball or swung a bat\u201d but, nevertheless, \u201cplayed with other chaps.\u201dNow, the reader who has kept the pun in mind may interpret this to mean that, while the child didn\u2019t play with Chapmans\u2014that is, his athletic peers\u2014he was able to play with other chaps\u2014that is, his non-athletic peers. Another reading would be that these \u201cother chaps\u201d were not only non-athletic peers, but the other Chapmans, that is, peers who were, like him, literary.

The particular positions in which both of these shoes finally settle is not conclusive, but we see that the poet imagines one shoe leaning against the stake, which he likens to a drunk man leaning against a lamppost. In an earlier poem, \u201cThe Nature of Electricity,\u201d Shade ponders the possibility of souls residing in the filaments of lightbulbs, imagining one in a lamppost numbered 999, as harbouring the soul of \u201can old friend of mine.\u201d This horseshoe, then, which rests against the \u201clamppost,\u201d recalls a drunk man who is leaning on a friend; and since we know that Shade had a drinking problem, we may infer that this drunk man is he. \u2014But who is the friend?As we have observed elsewhere, this lamppost, \u201cnumber nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine,\u201d seems to make an oblique reference to Pale Fire\u2019s line 999, written a year later, which in turn makes reference to a gardener who is going to try, alas in vain, to save the poet\u2019s life, and who has clearly been presaged by a clockwork toy that the poet saw in his boyhood, moments before collapsing. It may be, then, that this metaphor of a friendly lamppost, may presage, without the poet\u2019s intention, the gardener who, in moments to come, is a \u201cfriend\u201d for trying to save him.Finally, since, in the game of horseshoes, the tossed shoes land in a pit of sand, perhaps the playing of this game just before the poet\u2019s death is an allusion to the lemniscate\u2014the sign for eternity\u2014which, in the first canto, he recalls being \u201cleft upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires.\u201d In fact, this is precisely the evocation made by the very next couplet, which describes a butterfly \u2018wheeling\u2019 in flight just above a patch of sand!

Likewise, the surname of the alleged Zemblan assassin, \u201cGradus,\u201d can be derived by curling one of his alleged aliases, \u201cD'argus,\u201d and reading from the \u201cg\u201d in the direction required to get \u201cGradus.\u201d (The result is not exact but, again, very encouraging.)In his comment to lines 347-348, Kinbote writes, \u201cI am quite sure it was I who one day, when we were discussing \u2018mirror words,\u2019 observed (and I recall the poet\u2019s expression of stupefaction) that \u2018spider\u2019 in reverse is \u2018redips,\u2019 and \u2019T.S. Eliot,\u2018 'toilest\u2019\u201d (implying perhaps that Eliot must\u2019ve toiled away to produce such turgid poetry.) Although both of these expressions are derived by a backwards spelling of their originals, they are also producible within the circular schema that we have just outlined.In the commentary to line 894, we learn that John Shade was said to bear a physical resemblance to that 18th century monarch of English letters, Doctor Samuel Johnson. The reader at this point would already have learned\u2013from the commentary to line 71\u2013that John Shade was son to Samuel Shade, who in the same note is said to have \u201cstudied medicine in his youth.\u201d But this is precisely the information derivable from the name of Shade\u2019s physical predecessor, \u201cDoctor Samuel Johnson\u201d, when curled into a circle; for it gives us, \u201cJohn son [of] Doctor Samuel.\u201d This might furnish us with a happy reference to Johnson\u2019s famous Dictionary of the English Language, in which an appropriate portion of a clairvoyant entry might have gone something like,Shade, John Francis: 1898-1959, American poet and son of Doctor Samuel Shade, distinguished American ornithologist.Interestingly, Shade, who harboured a lifelong obsession with the afterlife, has a name which, when subjected to our schema, yields \u201cHades,\u201d the name in Greek mythology given to that dark and gloomy realm where the souls, or \u2018shades\u2019, of all mortals were believed to go upon their death. Likewise, the name of that fictional kingdom, \u201cZembla,\u201d of which the deluded commentator of Pale Fire believes himself to be former king, yields \u201cemblaze\u201d\u2013that is, to illuminate or kindle, as by a blaze. This self-styled king-in-exile, Charles the Beloved, teaching in America under the name of Charles Kinbote, hopes more than anything that, by barraging his favourite poet and colleague with historical anecdotes, Zembla, its exiled king, and his great escape will function as the primary inspiration behind an upcoming masterpiece in heroic couplets. It is in this sense, then, that Zembla is to \u201cemblaze;\u201d it is to spark, it is to kindle, it is to inspire the writing of a poem which is to reflect, even if by a pale light, its brilliant fire.This interpretation is corroborated by Kinbote\u2019s diction when, remarking on the poem, he laments,Although I realize only too clearly, alas, that the result, in its pale and diaphanous final phase, cannot be regarded as a direct echo of my narrative [\u2026], one can hardly doubt that the sunset glow of the story acted as a catalytic agent upon the very process of the sustained creative effervescence that enabled Shade to produce a 1000-line poem in three weeks.And here, by Shade\u2019s diction in the poem, when describing poetic inspiration:Now I shall speak\u2026 Better than any soapIs the sensation for which poets hopeWhen inspiration and its icy blaze,The sudden image, the immediate phraseOver the skin a triple ripple sendMaking the little hairs all stand on end", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Shade\u2019s family and the tragedy that rocked it: these are the principle concerns of the second canto. We learn of the poet\u2019s boyhood cogitations on mortality, and find him, in later years, regretting the lack of imagination in all the traditional conceptions of the afterlife. Turning then to his central theme, he first recalls his \u201cbizarre aunt Maud,\u201d an amateur artist and second mother who began to look after him when he was only a small boy. Her final days were sadly met with paralysis, madness, and the speech deterioration with which she struggled in a sanatorium until her death. He next reminisces over his wife in their younger days when he discovered his love for her, and recalls with a heavy heart the troubled existence of their only child, and that cold, ominous night on which she walked herself into a lake and drowned.The canto teems with signs and symbols both artistic and portentous. During a fieldtrip in their high-school days Shade is touched by the beauty of his future wife as she loafs recumbent on a patch of green. Her hand, pressed against the soft turf, is flanked by a rock and a \u201cstar of trillium,\u201d as if Nature were whispering: Place a star-like stone on her fingers, John.Pine-signs: On the day of his aunt\u2019s death the poet happens upon a pine tree on whose trunk is observed a \u201cgum-logged ant,\u201d the death of a thing forever paralyzed phonetically recalling \u201caunt\u201d; on that same tree is an \u201cempty emerald,\u201d a green chrysalis whose vacancy reminds one, not only of death, but of a possible transmigration in the sequel. The pine tree? The pine tree bears his pine-signs, signs of pining, pining over his lost aunt.Regarding the tragedy of the poet\u2019s only child ominous symbols abound: The recondite words for whose meanings she inquires quietly indicate her death; on the night of her grisly suicide omens occur when clocks point to her age; and the television programming viewed by her anxious parents as they await her return from a blind-date is eerily replete with covert references to her final act.This tabulation is by no means comprehensive; but strikes me as too copious to be prolonged in this proem. I must, however, expatiate on the most significant symbol in the poem, one whose artistic perfection is realized in the final line of the present canto.The lemniscate, a sidewise figure-eight, is both the mathematical symbol for infinity and the meteorological symbol for haze, allowing for numerous allusions to the poet\u2019s daughter, Hazel, and to the great eternal beyond in which he yearns so desperately to find her. It also resembles, if only linearly, the outstretched wings of a butterfly, to which the structure of the poem might allude, being described by its Zemblan annotator as a thousand-line poem, with its two central cantos, identical in length, \u201csolid and ample, forming together with the shorter flanks twin wings of five hundred verses each.\u201d The wings he has in mind evidently are those of a bird, variants of which figure here and there throughout the poem. But what, like so much else, has escaped his notice, is the consummate symbolism achieved by having the four cantos represent, not four parts of two identical wings, but the two identical pairs of wings unfurled by the butterfly,species of which also figure throughout the poem, and, more importantly, represent a form of life-after-death. For it is by this added feature that the poem\u2019s structure can reflect its main themes of life, death, and a possible existence thereafter.Moreover, that the death of Hazel is located at the very last line of the first half of the poem suddenly bursts with significance. We see that the first half of the poem dwells on the lives of the poet\u2019s loved ones, while the second half focuses on the afterlife to which those loved ones may have passed. So, if the structure of the poem is a lemniscate, at the nexus of which we find a death, then its first volute represents life, its second volute the afterlife. This would suggest, quite poetically, that death is the pinch in life\u2019s lemniscate, out of which one hopes to swerve to dwell again in a second volute. Since this is precisely the lifecycle of lepidoptera-as the caterpillar lives and dies only to be \u2018reborn\u2019 as a butterfly-it is all the more apt and lovely that the same symbol that represents Haze(l), infinity, and the structure of the poem, should at the same time represent a butterfly in flight, registering the poet\u2019s hope for his daughter in the afterlife. Bolstering this interpretation, I think, is not only Hazel\u2019s unsightliness as highlighted by her father and represented by the caterpillar, but the following lines in the third canto: \u201cLater came minutes, hours, whole days at last, When she\u2019d be absent from our thoughts, so fast Did life, the wooly caterpillar run.\u201d It\u2019s as if to say, since life for Hazel was a caterpillar, may the afterlife be a butterfly.To clinch this interpretation, the reader will note that, not only does her ugliness make apt the poet\u2019s comparison between Hazel and \u201cthe woolly caterpillar,\u201d but her particular method of suicide, and his hopes for her survival in the afterlife, especially do too. For, the caterpillar\u2019s self-induced metamorphosis is, in a sense, a kind of suicide; and the development it undergoes is especially redolent of drowning: Inside the chrysalis, \u201cthe chewing mouthparts of the caterpillar are transformed into the sucking mouthparts of the butterfly,\u201d which lives on a strictly liquid diet. \u201cWhen the butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, its wings are small and wet[.] The butterfly must pump fluids from its abdomen through the veins in its wings, which causes the wings to expand to their full size.\u201d How marvelous!One hopes, in writing such an expansive note, to silence those reviewers who find the poem of Pale Fire neither fiery nor poetic, but rather pale and pedestrian, poor to the point of being a disguised prank on the part of Nabokov. That this opinion can emerge from only a superficial reading is something that the outspread marginalia on this page is intended to convey.

Was the source of at least this coincidence an artistic, godlike being, who manipulated and played with Shade\u2019s world for the sake of his own aesthetic appreciation?My scholia are like Kinbote\u2019s only half scholastic; but unlike his, mine are designed to illuminate another man\u2019s life without appropriating it.

In so doing, I submit that the poet was right. Shade\u2019s world was indeed manipulated by an artistic being from a world beyond his. For his was a world of fiction, and ours the world of the author of that fiction, who dictated its artistic elements for our own aesthetic appreciation. In other words, Shade\u2019s god was Nabokov; and by examining the artful parallels and coincidences that he conjured into Shade\u2019s world, we can, I believe, derive that immense aesthetic appreciation for the sake of which that world was created.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Our poet seems in the fourth canto reconciled to his fate. Having sobbed out his agony over the tragic loss of his daughter; having recalled her troubled life, its tender moments, and the ominous night of her ugly suicide; having revisited his guilt and keen despair and struggled to rationalize some form of the afterlife up which his hopes might clamber, he seems now to enjoy a respite, a tranquil temperament with which he treats the reader to some light and desultory musings.He first relates his bemusement over two methods of composition. Method \u201cA\u201d, he tells us, consists of the penless poet caught off-guard by the murmured combinations of a garrulous muse: In the shower, on a long drive or perhaps browsing at the local mart, the poet bound by quotidian tasks is turned automaton when the unbidden words and numbers crowd him from an unknown source. Method \u201cB\u201d, on the other hand, is planned and deliberate: The poet here is found at his usual perch\u2014the heavy desk, grand lectern or quiet arbour\u2014on schedule with his allotted time and faithful utensils, actively trying to round out the stubborn line or broken stanza, calculating, forming pictures, waiting for the right term or trope to present itself as he sits staring at his daunting pages.In connection to this is the everyday aesthetics that Shade moves on to highlight next. As he advances from a droll episode of somnambulation to a nick on the throat while shaving we see him yet again accentuate the beautiful details in the mundane.He next expresses his calm content over the metaphysical view he\u2019s finally adopted regarding gods\u2014cosmic artists working on the world\u2014and the hope it gives him of one day reuniting with his daughter: \u201cI\u2019m reasonably sure that we survive And that my darling somewhere is still alive, As I am reasonably sure that I Shall wake at six tomorrow on July\u201d etcetera, etcetera. We find out from his commentator, of course, that on the morrow Shade does not wake; that, moments after penning these final lines, he is shot dead by an assassin who misidentifies him as the intended target.Tragic as this might be, it is infinitely more artistic, and puzzling. The last stanza, which he had just completed to finish off his poem and which included a description of his immediate surroundings before his death, reveals, unknown to its author, that the circumstances of his end were presaged by the circumstances of a collapse he suffered in his boyhood, soon after his eleventh birthday. That collapse\u2014related in the first stanza\u2014culminated in \u201ca sudden sunburst in my head. And then black night. That blackness was sublime. I felt distributed through space and time,\u201d which, if one is rereading the book, suggests that, if the circumstances of this collapse mirrored the circumstances of his death, then perhaps the out-of-body experience which resulted from that collapse was mirroring the experience he would enjoy immediately after his death. As I have emphasized elsewhere, these foretelling parallels, unlike the many we have found between events involving his wife and his daughter, could not have been ad hoc fabrications that the poet inserted into his poem, because what gives significance to these parallels is his very own death, of which he could not have known prior to the fact nor written of it in the sequel. This then is a chestnut, but I think I\u2019ve cracked it elsewhere, showing Nabokov to be that artist-god who, working on the world of Shade and acting as his muse, fashions these aesthetic parallels and writes them into his hero\u2019s poem.That some critics have deemed this work an uninspired third-rate effort is an absurd judgment which it has been the aim of these notes to overturn and laugh at.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "From the third canto we learn that, years ago, when their daughter was still \u201ca mere tot,\u201d the poet and his wife attended meetings at the Institute of Preparation for the Hereafter (I.P.H.), a sort of quack institute whose objective was to provide insight and guidance on the afterlife, and at which Shade and other guests were invited to give lectures on the topic as it was understood from their respective areas of expertise, whether secular or spiritual.This wide array of eschatological exposure proves to be influential to Shade\u2019s life-long search for the great beyond, but only, he tells us, in so far as it informs him of all that has been amiss in humanity\u2019s numerous conceptions of a possible afterlife. His long acute sensibility to the world\u2019s delightful details refuses to accept as desirable any such possibility that lacks the memory of those details from one\u2019s existence prior to death. Moreover, he seems to suggest that what is essential to our individual identities is the set of memories we accumulate from our day-to-day experiences, which, were it destroyed by death, would make impossible our self-same continuation in any form of life thereafter\u2014going so far as to declare,[\u2026] I\u2019ll turn down eternity unlessThe melancholy and the tendernessOf mortal life; the passion and the pain;The claret taillight of that dwindling planeOff Hesperus; your gesture of dismayOn running out of cigarettes; the wayYou smile at dogs; the trail of silver slimeSnails leave on flagstones; this good ink, this rhyme,This index card, this slender rubber bandWhich always forms, when dropped, an ampersand,Are found in Heaven by the newlydeadStored in its strongholds through the years.\"That this likens Shade\u2019s conception of personal identity to that of the 17th-century British philosopher, John Locke, is a line of thought most likely to produce a tremendous yawn. For a proper understanding of the poem, and of the man who wrote it, it is better to focus on that which is related in the rest of the canto, beginning with the poet\u2019s temporary death, his vision of the hereafter, his heightened obsession with the question of a possible life after death, and the eventual relaxation of this obsession by the adoption of a strange metaphysical conception of the world and the gods beyond it.It is at a poetry club some months after the suicide of his daughter where John Shade, after giving a talk on \u2018Why Poetry is Meaningful to Us\u2019, collapses and experiences, while being momentarily dead, what he feels certain is a vision from the great beyond. His description of this vision is, I believe, of no minor significance, because it seems to sketch, or at least I like to imagine that it does, roughly what could be interpreted as the formation of a chrysalis as it would appear from the inside, raising yet again the possibility of a life after death somewhat similar to that which is enjoyed by a caterpillar, once it has metamorphosed into a butterfly. \u201c[B]lood-black nothingness began to spin a system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem.\u201dAre we to understand this as an implication by Nabokov, however well he may have slipped it by his hero, that Shade\u2019s soul, hanging momentarily on the threshold of the afterlife, glimpsed its own reincarnation before it was revived back into its human form? The credence of the reader here is no doubt meant to strain.At any rate, the experience quickens his lifelong wonder at the great beyond, and, by presenting something to which he can fasten his desperate hope of one day reuniting with his dead daughter, heightens his passionate search for answers more definitive.Having seen in his vision an object that he can only describe as a white fountain, he is amazed when reading an account of a similar vision in which the same object seems to have appeared. Tracking down with all alacrity both the author of the article and the subject of this vision, however, leads to sore disappointment when it is revealed to him that an overlooked typo in the printed edition had resulted in a \u201cfountain\u201d where what was intended was \u201cmountain\u201d.Desperate and despairing, Shade has what might charitably be described as an epiphany about life: These visions, that article, that typo, all these things coming together to cause a bustle and a brouhaha, are just some of the countless little details and coincidences in life that betoken the intelligent, artistic manipulation of the world by a realm of gods far beyond it. Indeed, the stuff of this world, being both the canvas and the paints, the tokens and the registers in a game, the instruments in an orchestra, are manipulated and arranged by god-like beings for the sake of their own aesthetic appreciation.Yes! It sufficed that I in life could findSome kind of link-and-bobolink, some kindOf correlated pattern in the game,Plexed artistry, and something of the samePleasure in it as they who played it found.It did not matter who they were. No sound,No furtive light came from their involuteAbode, but there they were, aloof, and mute,Playing a game of worlds, promoting pawnsTo ivory unicorns and ebon fauns:Kindling a long life here, extinguishingA short one there; killing a Balkan king;Causing a chunk of ice formed on a high-Flying airplane to plummet from the skyAnd strike a farmer dead; hiding my keys,Glasses or pipe. Coordinating theseEvents and objects with remote eventsAnd vanished objects. Making ornamentsOf accidents and possibilities.\u201dA sublime, uncanny, and altogether insane conception, it is this aesthetic, metaphysical picture of the world to which Shade finally fastens his hopes, and his reader can only smile when it dawns on him that, in so far as Shade was a fictional character, in so far as fiction can be said to be orchestrated by a realm of beings well beyond its own, the poet, in this instance, was right.", "autor_orig": "John Francis Shade", "titulo_orig": "Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "\u201cLife is a message scribbled in the dark,\u201c signed \u2018Anonymous,\u2019 reminds us that we can discern neither the meaning of life, nor its \u2018author\u2019.

Are we to infer that, since the first two terms apply, the third must too, and that Hazel still exists somewhere in some supernatural, everlasting form?Not so fast. We must remember that the poem is composed by the girl\u2019s father, well after her death; a deeply mournful father, weighed down by guilt, and desperately hoping for an afterlife, some form of existence which has preserved his daughter and of which he is finally convinced by adopting some absurd but comforting metaphysical picture.\u201cI\u2019m reasonably sure that we surviveAnd that my darling somewhere is alive.\u201dThe invention of coincidences to enforce a pet theory explains the above, but it cannot explain the astonishing parallels between the circumstances of the mental collapse Shade suffered in his childhood and the circumstances of his own death after the composition of the poem.

Afterwards he moved to Bukhara and became established as one of the major mathematicians and astronomers of the medieval period. He is the author of one of the most important treatises on algebra written before modern times, the Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra, which includes a geometric method for solving cubic equations by intersecting a hyperbola with a circle.[4] He contributed to a calendar reform.His significance as a philosopher and teacher, and his few remaining philosophical works, have not received the same attention as his scientific and poetic writings.

Camden was very influential in the early days of Discordia, so let\u2019s talk a little more about him.Camden is the author of \u201cZen without Zen Masters\u201d, published in 1977. He has a somewhat fresh take on Zen Buddhism.\u201cThere are two approaches to getting into Zen. The formal approach is to study with a Japanese Zen Master. The informal approach is an individual study program using whatever materials are available, what I call Western Zen. I see it as the next step in the radical Zen tradition.\u201dKerry Thornely dedicated his book Zenarchy to Camden.23ae cabalmate Telarus KSC (Keeper of the Contradictory Cephalopod, Zenarchist Swordsman, Tender to the Edible Zen Garden, Ratcheting Metallic Sex Doll of The End Times, Episkopos of the Amorphous Dreams Cabal) provides this review:ZWZM is only half about zen. The other half is sexual philosophy/politics influenced by the Kerista Commune (Brother Judd\u2019s sect). Common Sense Tarot (another of the Cont of Five\u2019s works) was the best tarot book I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s very interesting to see that quality of western and eastern esoterica out of one personality. [Camden] was pretty influential in how the original Discordian society manifested.That said, if you read ZWZM, you should start with the knowledge that only about half the book is influenced by Zen practices (although it greatly clarified a few things for me), but it\u2019s all mixed into the sexual philosophy/politics stuff.Do you get the feeling he\u2019s about to smack you?The \u201cCamp Meeker Cabal\u201d which Benares lists under his name is probably a reference to Camp Meeker, California.Benares passed away in the year 2000.

The student has to go through the motions of enlightenment, motions which he will learn are paradoxically both necessary and irrelevant.

We\u2019ll come back to the Chao, as it appears all over the Principia. For now, let\u2019s look at the Nietzche quote.The quote originates from the prologue of Nietzsche\u2019s book Thus Spoke Zarathustra (which you can read here).What is a \u201cdancing star\u201d? The image of the star occurs a few times in Thus Spake Zarathustra, referring to destiny and divine purpose. The stars are fixed heavenly bodies which we use to navigate. But these times call for us to give birth to our own stars and constellations, to come up with our own reasons for living. Nietzsche loved dancing, he thought it was the most genuine expression of the human soul. In order to create great works, to be great people, we need passion and freedom. With an awareness of these things, we may give birth to our own set of values, our own dancing stars.Nietzsche\u2019s Zarathustra (whose name means \u201cGold Star\u201d) wishes to free us from false dualities like good/bad and good/evil. Nietzsche thought our system of valuation is stuck, like a broken record, repeating the same dialog over and over again for the last two thousand years. If we accept these dualities as real, then we should be comfortable with the world they have created.But Nietzsche asks \u201cWhat\u2019s next? And how do we get there?\u201d  The answer lies in giving birth to our own stars, rather than accepting the framework that\u2019s been passed down to us. The quote printed in the Principia occurs in this passage:It is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ of his highest hope.Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow thereon.Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man \u2014 and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself.Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.\u201cWhat is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?\u201d\u2014 so asketh the last man and blinketh.The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.\u201cWe have discovered happiness\u201d\u2014 say the last men, and blink thereby.They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth. One still loveth one\u2019s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for one needeth warmth.Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much poison at last for a pleasant death.One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one.One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.\u201cFormerly all the world was insane,\u201d\u2014 say the subtlest of them, and blink thereby.They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is no end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon reconciled \u2014 otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health.\u201cWe have discovered happiness,\u201d\u2014 say the last men, and blink thereby.Passion and freedom and poison: that is the invigorating but dangerous cocktail that we must drink to free us of the old moral systems. Zarathustra leads us beyond good and evil into postmodernity.The Principia, with its emphasis on context, joy, re-appropriation, and self-generated meaning, establishes itself as a postmodern work. It holds our values at arms length, because they are little more than social constructs. Instead, it emphasizes the individual\u2019s unique relationship with values and culture and identifies this as a potential avenue for new growth.\"http://23ae.com/2011/11/annotated-principia-discordia-page-10-the-sacred-chao/", "autor_orig": "Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst and Malcalypse the Younger", "titulo_orig": "The Principia Discordia", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "Cram sez;\u201cThese are not just random numbers.

She doesn\u2019t think we need to keep passing forward this twisted and conflicted moral code from thousands of years ago. One of the problems with organized religions is that its adherents must internalize a bunch of conclusions that somebody else reached. They wrote down their conclusions, dressed them up in symbolism and mythological language, and told people that it\u2019s the right way to live.

He was a mysterious rapper who sounded strangely similar to Nas and never showed his face. A lot of people drew comparisons to the Action Bronson and Ghostface Killah situation. Bronson and Droog are both White rappers who sound like older Black rappers. However, Bronson never hid his face from the public, so you knew that he definitely wasn\u2019t Ghostface in disguise. Things were a bit different with Droog. While there were a couple of pictures and a video floating around that supposedly showcased Droog rhyminghis appearance wasn\u2019t confirmed until about a week before his debut concert in September 2014 (which I attended).After much speculation, internet chatter and an incredibly detailed video by MarcoPoloVision showing that Droog had to be Nas in disguiseDroog\u2019s hype was rapidly growing. Droog finally put everything to rest by revealing his face in a video he recorded of him rapping with DJ Skizz in the background:About a week after, Droog held his first concert at The Studio at Webster Hall in NYC. The opening acts included Boston rapper, Michael Christmas and Flushing, Queens, NYC rappers, Timeless Truth.I went to the show to see Droog in person. Despite the biting accusations, I really enjoyed the EP. Droog has incredible wordplay and simply knows how to rap. Plus, I also know Timeless Truth from around the way and I wanted to support them as well.Droog performed some rhymes over famous Rap beats as well as material from the EP and eventual LP.It was a decent show, everybody did their thing onstage. I wish Droog brought out a special guest (like Prodigy for \u201cHoodie Weather\u201d). He did play cee-lo with Sean Price but Sean was the special guest for Timeless Truth\u2019s set.I also saw Droog perform in July 2015 at the 38th Anniversary of The Rock Steady Crew in Central Park. I noticed that he was more confident onstage than at his debut concert. Part of the reason is that he\u2019s been touring the world since then and has even opened several times for Prhyme (DJ Premier & Royce Da 5'9\") on their recent tour.Unfortunately, at the RSC show, Droog was performing for a crowd of mostly Old School Hip Hop fans (people in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s) who were only there to see Whodini and Big Daddy Kane perform. They weren\u2019t very receptive to Droog\u2019s performance. However, if an artist is to evolve, they need to do shows like this. Every show can\u2019t be a lovefest. I think he should use that experience and become stronger and tighten up his stage show a bit more. Overall, even though he does sound like Nas, I do think he\u2019s a dope emcee and I hope he continues to drop solid projects in the future.", "autor_orig": "PlatanoPeddler", "titulo_orig": "My Rap CD Collection", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "On August 8th, 2015, rapper Sean Price (of Heltah Skeltah and Boot Camp Clik fame) passed away in his sleep at the age of 43. He was one of the leading artists of Duck Down Records and he was also one of my favorite rappers of all time.The first time that I heard of Sean Price was on Heltah Skeltah\u2019s \u201cI Ain\u2019t Havin' That\u201d video. It was a minor hit but I loved it as a teenager.In the early 2000\u2019s, I started getting into underground Rap. One of the earliest groups that I got interested in was Jedi Mind Tricks. They did a song with Sean Price called \u201cBlood Runs Cold\u201d, which was the b-side to the \u201cRetaliation\u201d single that dropped in 2001.I didn\u2019t become a real fan of Heltah Skeltah or Sean Price until Grand Theft Auto 3 came out in 2001. GTA 3 was a revolutionary video game that brought the sandbox genre to the forefront and the best song in that game was \u201cRising To The Top\u201d which was featured as a bonus cut on Monkey Barz.Monkey Barz was part of Duck Down Records 2005 \u201cTriple Threat\u201d campaign in which they were going to reemerge as an Indie powerhouse. Monkey Barz, 9th Wonder & Buckshot\u2019s Chemistry and Smif-N-Wessun\u2019s Smif-N-Wessun: Reloaded were part of this campaign and fashion designer, Marc Ecko, provided support in the form of graphic design and promotion. All the albums are great but Sean Price really made his mark with this project. If Duck Down was a baseball team, then after Monkey Barz, Sean Price was the captain.He accomplished this by continuing his penchant for bare knuckle, hood raps but now mixed in with some honest reflection. One great example is \u201cBrokest Rapper You Know\u201d:It\u2019s father\u2019s day and I ain\u2019t get shit for none of my kidsFound a new way to buildFuck rap, started selling 2-ways and pillsWhen the stomach growls, and the fridge bareAnd you starving, and your kid\u2019s thereIt\u2019s\u2026. motherfuckin' critical paMy pursuit of this rap loot is straight trivial, paLines like these really show what it\u2019s like to be a struggling Indie rapper with a family to feed. There were times after the 90\u2019s in which Sean had to take on construction jobs or sell drugs in order to provide for his family. A lot of rappers brag about their fortunes (or they pretend to have more money than they really do). Sean made music that related more to the average dude in the hood who had to find different jobs to take care of his family.What also propelled Sean to new heights was incorporating more humor into his lyrics. The song \u201cFake Neptune\u201d is one example. The title alone is hilarious. It was produced by Phat Babyz but because it sounds like a Neptunes beat, they called the track \u201cFake Neptune\u201d.Sean sets the tone right away with lines likeHow you gonna shit on me?After I let you shit on me, freaky deakyOn a, world tour, with Muhammad, my manIn a piece of shit truck, smelling like vomit and hamAnother one of my personal favorite tracks is \u201cHeartburn\u201d.9th Wonder provides a soulful sonic backdrop while Sean Price lets you know what he\u2019s grateful for. However, he does this in true Sean Price fashion.I love it when my bitch cook, come homeTo a hot meal, it\u2019s not real, the bitch can\u2019t cookI love when you say my song is cornyAt the same time, huggin' my nuts, the god stay hornyI\u2019m also a huge fan of \u201cSpliff-N-Wessun\u201d. The title is an obvious reference to the rap group, Smif-N-Wessun, who are also part of Duck Down Records. Ayatollah provides the beat on this one. Sean Price and Ruste Juxx trade bars on this. This is also the first time that I heard of Ruste.As usual, Sean stole the show.Niggas actin' like my motherfuckin' gat don\u2019t workTil you hit and then collapse in the dirt and screamin' \u2018that shit hurt\u2019Motherfuckin' right, that shit hurtWe ain\u2019t got no trackThree songs, one session, it\u2019s econo-rapI never got to formally meet Sean P but I have seen him live over the years. The first time that I saw him live was at Duck Down Records' 15th Anniversary show at BB Kings, NYC in July 2010. He performed with Rock, his partner-in-rhyme from Heltah Skeltah. The crowd was anticipating Sean P the most that night and he didn\u2019t disappoint.In June 2011, I saw Sean P perform with his group Random Axe. The group also includes Black Milk and Guilty Simpson, both from Detroit.Sean Price and Buckshot made a special guest appearance during Smif-N-Wessun\u2019s set at a Prospect Park show in July 2011.The last time that I saw Sean Price in person was at Your Old Droog\u2019s debut concert in September 2014. Timeless Truth, the homies from Flushing, Queens, were one of the opening acts. They were friends with Sean P and they brought him out as a special guest during their set. Sean performed \u201cSTFU Part 2\u201d from Mic Tyson. At around 22 seconds, you can see Sean P extending his fist to give me dap.He also came back later on during Droog\u2019s set. Him, Droog and Timeless Truth played a game of cee-lo onstage.It was great seeing him make a surprise visit. I had no idea it would be the last time that I would ever see him in person. His death is an unfortunate one not only because he was such a great rapper but because he was relatively young (43). He left behind a wife and kids and also left behind a legion of fans who did give a shit about him. I know he had some reservations regarding his fanbasehttps://youtu.be/4YRFBu9Jry8?t=10m17sbut I think the outpouring of support and love since his passing showed that his fans did honestly give a damn.

Personally, Ironman (GFK\u2019s debut) is my favorite in his discography but Supreme Clientele is a close second.I\u2019m not going to lie. After seeing GFK roast Action Bronson for his comments on Sports Nation, I was reminded of just how great GFK truly is. \u201cWhere the fuck is your Supreme Clientele\u2019s, nigga?\u201d inspired me to to annotate this album.https://youtu.be/z93IaKPY_Wc?t=4m25sThe album came out when I was 14 years old and in the 9th grade. I was a full blown Wu-Tang fan at that point and I bought this album the day that it dropped. Surprisingly, a lot of my friends weren\u2019t so quick to get the album. But I knew right off the bat that it was a classic. GFK\u2019s kitchen sink, stream of consciousness style over incredible, prime Wu production. Guest spots from the Clan and affiliates plus carefully placed Iron Man and kung fu movie samples made this a special album.My friends and I would sarcastically sing the Intro in the back of the bus. GFK used part of the theme song from the 1966 Iron Man cartoon TV show for the Intro.I\u2019ll never forget the first time I heard \u201cMighty Healthy\u201d. This was before downloading became the main way people got their music. I bought the album and put it into my CD player and went track by track. That dusty kung fu sample about killers brought back that Enter The Wu feel and then the beat dropped. I think I rewound that beat drop about 10 times the first time I heard this song. This is no holds barred, dusty sample, grimy basement concert venue music. I knew the first time that I heard it, it would be my favorite SC album cut and it still remains so til this day.I\u2019ve seen GFK live 3 times and this is definitely a fan favorite. When I saw him in 2012, his DJ, J-Love introduced the song with a depressing Schoolhouse Rock song called \u201cFigure 8\u201d.But it worked. That song meshed well with \u201cMighty Healthy\u201d live.\u201cBuck 50\u201d is Wu extravaganza featuring Method Man, Cappadonna, Masta Killa and Redman. An upbeat and frantic RZA beat brought the best out of Meth. I think he had the best verse on the track although GFK\u2019s 2nd verse was nasty too.When I think of a triumphant beat, I think of the \u201cApollo Kids\u201d beat. GFK and Raekwon just stunting on everybody. The production is big and in your face. Fuck just the rap, the whole song is like ziti.The \u201cClyde Smith\u201d skit was weird. After 50 Cent and The Madd Rapper (aka D-Dot) dropped \u201cHow To Rob,\u201d a lot of rappers were upset. Jay-Z and Big Pun threw shots at 50. In 1999, I took part in an interview with The Madd Rapper and he stated that Raekwon was one of the few who understood that the track was a joke and didn\u2019t have anything bad to say to 50 or him. I guess as time wore on, Rae changed his opinion. Rather than drop a straight up diss track, he distorted his voice and changed his name to throw a shot at 50. It was so absured that it was comical. I don\u2019t know if he was trying to scare 50 with that deep voice distortion but it definitely made me laugh. I guess this was Wu making a point that dissing their members won\u2019t go unnoticed. Regardless, it was one of the most memorable moments in Supreme Clientele.\u201cAnd I\u2019m a have my little snacks and all that with me\u201d\u201cAnd your haircut game is fucked up\u201d\u201cThat nigga is a dah duh dah duh nigga\u201d", "autor_orig": "PlatanoPeddler", "titulo_orig": "My Rap CD Collection", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "I ordered Action Bronson\u2019s Bon Appetit\u2026Bitch!!! mixtape from J-Love\u2019s website.

The first time I heard of Joell Ortiz was a guest feature that he had on Kool G. Rap\u2019s 2002 album, The Giancana Story. I knew about Crooked I (although I wasn\u2019t really a fan) from his dealings with Death Row Records in the early 2000\u2019s. Each artist tried to make it in the Rap industry as solo entities but they experienced hardships. That mutual understanding of the pitfalls of the music industry is what brought this group together. It\u2019s almost like a comic book, superhero group type of aesthetic.Like most real Slaughterhouse fans, my introduction to the group was Joe Budden\u2019s song, \u201cSlaughterhouse\u201d, that was featured on his 2008 album, Halfway House.The song features all members of the group as well as Nino Bless (who didn\u2019t make the group despite being on this song). The track was incredible and when I heard they were forming a group afterwards, I anticipated their next move. They released tracks here and there, all leading up toward their 2009 debut album, Slaughterhouse.I bought the album at Fat Beats NYC on the day that it came out. Overall, I thought the album was good but I was hoping for better production choices and just more spazzing out in general. I think \u201cSound Off\u201d was a great way to start the album though.The Alchemist produced banger, \u201cMicrophone\u201d, is another favorite:But overall, it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting considering the hype that went into the group. I felt that tracks like \u201cMove On (Remix)\u201dor \u201cWack MC\u2019s\u201dare some of the songs that should have made the album. Those songs played to the strengths of the members of the group.

In 2000, he released a 12\" single for his song, \u201cHomepiss\u201d. The single contained three other songs, so some people have referred to it as an EP. When this came out, I downloaded the song \u201cHomepiss\u201d and instantly became a fan.He kind of reminded me of like a nerdy fusion of Lord Finesse and Mobb Deep, but in a good way.

He was down with the graffiti crew, TCK and he used to tag up my town. I took a picture of one of his tags on a mailbox once.There were Flushing rappers before Yak (Large Professor, Mic Geronimo, Royal Flush) and after (Action Bronson, Heems) but he was holding it down for this city at a time when very few were claiming it. So, I\u2019ve always respected him for that. He did a song on My Claim called \u201cQueens Life\u201d, which detailed his upbringing in Flushing, it was pretty spot on:I also like the title track, \u201cMy Claim,\u201d which has the best beat on the whole album imo:Yak attempted to do some club tracks on this album. Those songs didn\u2019t come out particularly well but I did like the beat on \u201cSpy On You,\u201d which gained some attention because it flipped the Amelie movie theme song:Yak released an album in 2012 called Gas Galaxy and he also participated in Noisey\u2019s The Rap Monument in 2014. It\u2019s a 42 minute song featuring various rappers, including Action Bronson and Heems, who are also from Flushing.", "autor_orig": "PlatanoPeddler", "titulo_orig": "My Rap CD Collection", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "This album dropped on 10/9/12. I bought it at Best Buy Union Square the week that it came out. I originally wanted to order the Deluxe Edition that came with bonus songs but at the time they were only available through Macklemore\u2019s website and I didn\u2019t want to order the album from there. If I was willing to wait a couple of years, I could have purchased a Deluxe copy at Starbucks. You can tell an artist has made it when Starbucks sells his album.Even though it was released in 2012, the album seemed to have an extended shelf life due to Macklemore\u2019s growing popularity and the 2014 Grammy Awards, which saw Macklemore and Ryan Lewis winning Grammy\u2019s for Best Rap Album, Best New Artist, Best Rap Performance (\u201cThrift Shop\u201d) and Best Rap Song (also \u201cThrift Shop\u201d). Their success at the Grammy\u2019s fueled a lot of hatred because many people felt that Kendrick Lamar was snubbed in favor of a White, radio friendly Rap group. Macklemore was so apologetic that he continuously  stated that Kendrick deserved the Best Rap Album award and even posted a text he sent to Kendrick on his social media pages:The Heist wasn\u2019t the best Rap album of 2012 (I think Killer Mike\u2019s R.A.P. Music or O.C. x Apollo Brown\u2019s Trophies are) but it\u2019s not as bad as some people make it out to be. Also, unlike Iggy Azalea or Vanilla Ice, Macklemore isn\u2019t a Culture Vulture. He\u2019s a real Hip Hop head. Just listen to \u201cI Said Hey\u201d, \u201cB-Boy\u201d or \u201cJimmy Iovine\u201d, a tale of an underground rapper who breaks into Interscope Records for the chance at signing with the label. People have this opinion that he blew up out of nowhere when in fact he was doing his thing in the underground for years before most of the world took notice of his work. I know this because the first time I ever heard of Macklemore was in 2006 or 2007. I was sent a link to his song \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d, which appeared on his 2005 album, The Language of My World.I liked the song and felt that he was offering an honest analysis of what it means to be a White rapper. So honest that most White rappers wouldn\u2019t tackle this type of topic. And this song came out in 2005, years before he became a household name. The song\u2019s lyrics apply more to his music now than they ever did before.In September 2010, I had the opportunity to see Blue Scholars live at the Bowery Ballroom in NYC. Blue Scholars are a Rap duo from Seattle, Washington, where Macklemore is from. I purchased the tickets to that show the day that they went on sale. At the time, Macklemore wasn\u2019t on the bill. He was added to the bill sometime after as well as Yonkers, NY rapper/singer, Outasight. I knew Macklemore and Ryan Lewis dropped the Vs EP, which was okay but I wasn\u2019t too crazy about it. Still, I was looking forward to seeing their performance. I happened to record their entire set on video too. They performed two songs that ended up on The Heist: \u201cMake The Money\u201d and \u201cWing$\u201d. At the time, both songs were so new that they still didn\u2019t have proper song titles.They absolutely killed it and what also caught me by surprise was how enthusiastic the crowd was for them. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis elicited a crowd reaction that was either as strong or stronger than the crowd reaction for the headliners, Blue Scholars. I knew they were going places but I couldn\u2019t predict the Platinum success or Grammy\u2019s domination.I think people\u2019s zealotry for their favorite artists clouds their minds. Macklemore has proven throughout his career that he cares about Hip Hop. How can anybody call him a Culture Vulture? He toiled in the underground for years and finally made it. Rappers like Chief Keef or Bobby Shmurda, those are the real Culture Vultures. People don\u2019t see it that way because they\u2019re Black and from the hood but to me, a Culture Vulture is someone who doesn\u2019t care about the culture and only seeks to profit from it. That sounds like Iggy, that sounds like Keef, that sounds like most commercial rappers out today. Being Black and from the hood is not an automatic pass if all you care about is making money. Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep, Kool G. Rap, Freddie Gibbs all have made or make hood music. The difference is that they respect the culture and respect the craft of lyricism. If Macklemore winning a Grammy over Kendrick bothers people, where was their outrage at the fact that Nas has never won a Grammy or that countless other rappers have been snubbed over the years?", "autor_orig": "PlatanoPeddler", "titulo_orig": "My Rap CD Collection", "autor_ref": null, "titulo_ref": null}, {"anotacion": "This is Cormega\u2019s 3rd full length album (Legal Hustle was more of a compilation album).

I even recall seeing advertisements for the album in Rap magazines at the time:Unfortunately for Mega, Def Jam shelved the album and he was eventually released from his contract in the early 2000\u2019s. However, tracks from the album found their way to the streets and were met with great fanfare. I remember being in the 9th grade in 1999 and one of my classmates was a huge Cormega fan. Back then, Napster was relatively new and still free, so he downloaded as much as he could and made me data discs full of Cormega\u2019s music as well as other artists.I heard songs like \u201cAngel Dust\u201d, \u201cThe Testament\u201d, \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d and \u201cOne Love\u201d (a response to Nas' Mega shoutout on \u201cOne Love\u201d).

And back in \u201899, my friend downloaded a lo-fi version of the song which gave it an even grittier feel.The album remained in limbo for so long because Mega didn\u2019t own the album masters, Def Jam did. Supposedly, Mega paid several hundred thousand dollars to obtain the masters from Def Jam.

Vinyl records have become really trendy over the past few years and lots of mom-and-pop vinyl shops have sprung up in Brooklyn as a result.The store is quite spacious and is well air conditioned. In comparison, Fat Beats was about \u00bcth the size and was very hot inside. Also, unlike Fat Beats, Rough Trade sells various genres whereas Fat Beats mostly stuck to Hip Hop.Rough Trade also doubles as a concert venue.  They\u2019ve had artists such as Action Bronsonand Large Professor perform live.Their prices are a bit high though. That definitely reminds me of Fat Beats, who used to sell CD\u2019s for $16 and $17. It didn\u2019t bother me so much to pay that amount for the JMT album but it was a bit steep for an EP. I bit the bullet though, I needed to own All Souled Out.

Most of the photo is in black and white and it shows the grit of New York. But then in the middle, you see this bright symbol that resembles the sun. When the time was right, I went out and bought a copy for myself and I was hooked ever since. Pete Rock\u2019s versatile production drew me in right away. He could go from jazzy to funky in an instant. CL Smooth\u2019s delivery perfectly complemented these beats. If the beat was hard, CL rocked it that way.

Even though I was aware of some of their earlier work because of my uncle, I didn\u2019t really get into the group until their 2nd full length album, Stone Crazy, which came out in 1997. By this time, Bronx Puerto Rican rapper, Big Pun, was on the rise. He collaborated with The Beatnuts as well as his fellow Terror Squad member, Cuban Link, on the track \u201cOff The Books\u201d from Stone Crazy.This is one of the first Pun and Cuban tracks that I\u2019ve ever heard and I became a fan of both rappers as a result.

I didn\u2019t find out about the attacks until Leadership class, which followed AP Spanish. The principal and vice principal walked into our class and explained to everyone what was going on. I thought it was a freak accident at first until my Leadership teacher turned on the radio and the reporters announced that a 2nd plane hit the WTC and that the country was under attack.

All I could think about were the World War II Kamikaze bombers that we read about in school.Later on that day, since my high school class was only about 400 students, we all huddled up in the school gym and saw live footage of the aftermath of the attacks. Some people were crying, concerned about their loved ones in the area. Others were upset. My biggest worry at that point was that President George W. Bush was going to institute a draft and that I would have to go fight overseas. Even to me, it was pretty obvious that there was going to be a war. And wars can last a long time.  For a 15 year old who was going to be 16 in a couple of months, I was nervous about that.After class, I remember some people were having problems with their cell phones and there was just general disarray. When I got home, I contacted my closest relatives to make sure everybody was alright. Fortunately, everybody was okay.As a result of the attacks, my local record stores had closed down early.

Most of the world became aware of Jin following his classic Freestyle Friday battles on the 106th & Park TV show on BET. But I heard of Jin even before that when he used to post on the message boards of UGHH.com. I remember hearing a couple of his songs back then, acknowledging that he was dope but I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d go further than internet message boards. When I heard that he was on 106th and Park, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was in high school at the time but I was glued to that show every Friday to see Jin\u2019s progress. He even battled Skyzoo back then before Sky had a name:Sky was Jin\u2019s toughest opponent but Jin killed him with that Tweet line. Anyway, flash forward a couple of years and Jin was already signed to Ruff Ryders and caught some buzz off of \u201cLearn Chinese\u201d. It seemed like Jin was going to be the first official, solo Asian rapper to make it. But then Ruff Ryder\u2019s completely dropped the ball. First, they barely promoted the album. Even though Jin was from Florida, he was repping Queens, NYC heavy back then (his family moved from Florida to Queens either in the late 90\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s) and he got very little support on radio, TV or in the streets. I only found out about his album release from seeing a poster in the streets somewhere. Then somebody at the label decided to release this piece of shit song as a single/video:Don\u2019t get me wrong, The Rest Is History is not a classic album. It\u2019s not even a great album, it\u2019s okay at best. But Jin had two songs on there that I think would have done better as singles. The first is \u201cGet Your Handz Off Me\u201d, produced by Neo Da Matrix and featuring Swizz Beatz. Supposedly, this was a \u201cpromotional single\u201d, but it barely got a push. Regardless, the beat and Swizz\u2019s presence gives it that official Ruff Ryders look:The other is \u201cI Got A Love,\u201d produced by and featuring Kanye West. Now, supposedly this was going to be the 2nd single but Roc-A-Fella blocked  the decision to use this song as a single because they didn\u2019t want to overexpose Kanye that year. Kanye\u2019s debut album, The College Dropout, dropped earlier that year and if this song was used as a single, Jin probably would have sold more units as a result of Kanye\u2019s growing popularity.Jin\u2019s 2nd album, The Emcee\u2019s Properganda was better than his debut but it was an Indie release and produced by Golden Child, a young, up and coming, underground producer. Jin\u2019s shot at commercial success dissipated and he was back to the underground. Hell, I even saw him live for free in June 2005. He did a free show on his birthday at the old Knitting Factory in Manhattan.Luckily for him, Asian fans support their own.

I believe Project Pat is affiliated with the latter. At some point, Loud Records (home of Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, Alkaholiks, Xzibit, Big Pun, etc) got a hold of other artists like Project Pat.

I had heard some of his work prior to this album but this was the album that made me a fan. It was released in 2006 and was produced (almost) entirely by Marco Polo. Rhymes are on point, production\u2019s on point. PH and Marco Polo were in rare form. If you haven\u2019t heard his other albums or haven\u2019t seen any of his battles, I highly suggest checking this album out first.My personal favorite track has to be \u201cAuthentic\u201d featuring DV Alias Khrist (think an underground, Brooklyn version of Nate Dogg).I actually met PH after a Ghostface Killah concert in Prospect Park, Brooklyn back in 2012. As I was leaving, I saw him and PackFM chilling. I gave them both dap and kept it moving.I also saw Immortal Technique bring out PH as a special guest at a 2012 concert. They performed \u201cPeruvian Cocaine\u201d alongside Diabolic and Poison Pen. I recorded that moment on video:Rest In Power, PH.EDIT 8/1/15:On Sunday, 7/26/15, The Rock Steady Crew held their 38th Anniversary show. A tribute was done in honor of PH. It included Jean Grae, The Bad Seed, GMS, Blitzkrieg, Wild Child, Mr. Medaphor, Immortal Technique, PackFM, Tonedeff, Diabolic and Poison Pen. PH\u2019s wife, Shawntay Ocascio, and their two sons also appeared onstage. She\u2019s pregnant with their daughter. It was very sad to see Shawntay onstage crying. I\u2019m not going to lie, I felt like shedding a tear myself. However, her sons had a lot of positive energy and you can tell that they\u2019ll help her get through this rough patch.

First, it was one of the first underground Rap albums that I ever heard.

His shocking content appealed to my \u201cteenage angst\u201d (Liotta laugh). I eventually grew out of his music but I still enjoy this record for what it is. My favorite track from here is \u201cUnderground\u201d, although \u201cSTD\u201d is the first Necro track that I ever heard/downloaded. \u201cX-Mas Freestyle\u201d has a special place in my heart though for the fact that I played it out loud in my high school English class for an oral presentation on Shock Rap. I started talking to the class about Necro and described him as an up and coming Jewish rapper out of Brooklyn (this was 2000 or 2001). One of the Jewish girls in my class was so excited to hear about a Jewish rapper that she couldn\u2019t wait until I played his track.

This girl was on some hard shit in school but she was crying hysterically because she had just met Mega, lel. Anyway, for whatever reason, I didn\u2019t bring all of my other Cormega CD inserts, I just brought the Legal Hustle insert which Mega and Dona both signed.

After 2Pac \u201ccaught a hot one\u201d he used the lift to go upstairs and he (or Zayd who was with 2Pac) gave his gun (\u201ctake this biscuit\u201d) to Lil\u2019 Shawn who hid it in the piano (Lil' Shawn recalls this in an interview with WWETV and says Biggie came back to retrieve the guns for 2Pac).The cops then came on the scene (the same cops that arrested him for the false allegation of rape) and said to him, \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging 2Pac?\u201d He then went to the hospital and got his wounds \u201cstitched up\u201d and \u201cleft the hospital that same night\u201d. Hence, Nas' lyrics above reflect 2Pac\u2019s life so these specific lines attack Nas exactly for that, saying, \u201cThis little n\u2014-a named Nas think he live like me / Talkin' \u2018bout he left the hospital, took five like me\u201d.In addition to this, 2Pac thought Nas was coming at him with future diss songs having already thought that Nas subliminally dissed him (2Pac thought the following was aimed at him) with the opening lines in \u201cThe Message\u201d, which go:Fake thug, no love, you get the slug CB4 Gusto /Your luck low, I didn\u2019t know \u2018til I was drunk though.\u201d2Pac took issue with this as he had seen Nas previously at the House of Blues (before July 1996) and told him that all this East v West hasn\u2019t got anything to do with him. So on that note, Nas and 2Pac were cool but then when he heard \u201cIt Was Written\u201d (which also influenced 2Pac in to writing \u201cMe and My Girlfriend\u201d), 2Pac felt Nas was talking about him (with the Fake thug line stated above) and that if Nas felt that way about him then he should have told him to his face at the House of Blues. He was thus expecting further shots from Nas as he (Nas) was also friends with Mobb Deep who 2Pac was also blatantly dissing and he has heard Nas was going to retaliate (this is according to Nas himself \u2013 see below).2Pac and Nas would meet again on the 4th of September 1996 at the afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards at Bryant Park in New York City. There are three/four versions of the events of this day. The first version is recalled by \u201cJungle\u201d who is Nas' brother. He claims, in the \u201cNas: Behind the Music\u201d documentary, that Nas grabbed 2Pac\u2019s shoulder from behind and said \u201cWhere you going, come here\u201d motioning a pulling gesture. Nas also claims, in this documentary, that, \u201cwe stepped to him and Suge and said, \u201cYou in our city, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Jungle claims in this interview that he was trying to get a gun from one of his friends that was standing behind Nas (Jungle claims he was stood next to Nas) so that he could shoot 2Pac (keep in mind that this is taking place in a public area at Bryant Park). Nas says, \u201cWe got to the bottom of it, then and there. I told him that I\u2019m hearing that you\u2019re about to diss me in a record and he says \u201cYea, I got this album where I came at you because I heard you was coming for me\u201d and I\u2019m like I got no songs about you, bro. And he (2Pac) was like, \u201cNas, me and you are brothers, we were never supposed to go at it; not me and you\u2026 I\u2019ll take that off the album, come meet me in Vegas.\u201dEdi Amin (a member of the Outlawz) in his interview with HipHopDX says that what Jungle is claiming is a lie. Fatal Hussein (another Outlaw) says that what Nas had said (not sure which interview he is referring to as Nas has spoke about this a few times) about his (Nas') version of events was also a lie and that it hurt him (Fatal) when he heard his (Nas') version of events, knowing he was lying. Fatal says (Edi confirms this in his DX interview and this can be seen in the Death Row East video interview) that he (Fatal) brought half of Jersey (hyperbole) with him, i.e. they had \u201cgoons\u201d left, right and centre. According to Edi:\u201cNas was only with his brother and like two other dudes. I remember that meeting well because \u2018Pac kept telling him, \u201cSpeak up! I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d Nas was saying in a low voice, \u201cThere\u2019s no beef, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d \u2018Pac was like, \u201cHuh? I can\u2019t hear you. Speak up!\u201d They squashed it after that because \u2018Pac was a Nas fan, as we all were.\u201dNas says the beef was settled and 2Pac told him that he was going to take the disses (these lines that you\u2019re reading) off his record (that includes Watch Ya Mouth \u2013 another Nas diss song) as they (Nas and 2Pac) were never meant to be at odds (no pun intended) with each other. 2Pac never got the chance to remove these lyrics. Nas says, \u201cI didn\u2019t see myself as his enemy but he (2Pac) felt like I was in the middle of this war with him\u2026 and that\u2019s the way (these diss records) he (2Pac) had to set if off\u201d.Nas says in an interview with Vlad TV, that, \u201cI saw him and he saw me. He had a bunch of people with him and I had a bunch of people with me. It could have gone either way\u2026 As the New York dude at the time it was my duty to see what was going on. So I went to see what was going on and he basically had, you know, there was some issues with Mobb (Deep) and at the time me and Mobb were a lot tighter and he had heard that I said things about him and I had heard he had this Makaveli album coming up and he (2Pac) told me what he was saying. And he was basically like, \u201cme and you were never supposed to go at it, not us, it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d He was gonna change all of that and come meet him in Vegas\u2026\u201dIt is also interesting to note that EDI Amin claims that 2Pac reached out to Nas prior to this event informing him that he was going to diss him. He says in his HipHopDX Interview, \u201cThe thing is after the Makaveli album, he said that he got that shit out of his system and he wasn\u2019t doing that anymore. He actually contacted Nas to let him know about the Makaveli album, and as a matter of fact, he was the only one that \u2018Pac reached out to. He told him that the album was coming out and that he was going after him in it.\u201dThere is also a Snoop version of events, where he says, \u201cHim (2Pac) and Nas at Central Park\u2026 It\u2019s so gangsta\u2026 it was the prequel to my interview with Angie Martinez (where Snoop says Biggie and Puffy are his homeboys!)\u2026 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right name of the park (Central Park) but it was a big a\u2013 park. So 2Pac and all of us from Death Row are mobbing. We see Nas so he (2Pac) walk up to Nas [and] Nas got about 100 goons with him and I know they\u2019re killers. But \u2018Pac ain\u2019t trippin\u2019, he just don\u2019t care. So he walk upon Nas [and] Nas reach upon to shake \u2018Pac hand. And Nas said, \u201cI got love for you \u2018Pac\u201d and 'Pac said, \u201cWell, n\u2014-, if you got love for me, I got a song coming out where I diss you, Jay-Z, Biggie.\u201d He named about forty\u2026 he named a bunch of n\u2014-s and he told Nas, \u201cIf you got love for me, n\u2014-, you ain\u2019t gonna say nothing after this record come out\u201d. And Nas shook his hand\u2026 (Snoop goes on to explain Nas embraced 'Pac and whilst doing that he looked over his shoulder and winked to his goons to indicate, don\u2019t do it) and Nas then said \u201cI love you 'Pac\u201d and they separated and then 'Pac looked at me, he said, \u201cI told you n\u2014- we got these n\u2014-s punked out here.\u201d But to me, Nas was gangster 'cause he didn\u2019t push the light.
